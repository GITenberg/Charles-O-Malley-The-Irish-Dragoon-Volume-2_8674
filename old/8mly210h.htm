<br><br><br><br><p>CHAPTER I.</p>

<p>THE DOCTOR'S TALE.[1]</p>

<p>"It is now some fifteen years since&mdash;if it wasn't for
O'Shaughnessy's<br>
wrinkles, I could not believe it five&mdash;we were quartered in
Loughrea. There<br>
were, besides our regiment, the Fiftieth and the Seventy-third,
and a troop<br>
or two of horse artillery, and the whole town was literally a
barrack, and<br>
as you may suppose, the pleasantest place imaginable. All the
young ladies,<br>
and indeed all those that had got their brevet some years before,
came<br>
flocking into the town, not knowing but the Devil might persuade
a raw<br>
ensign or so to marry some of them.</p>

<p>"Such dinner parties, such routs and balls, never were heard
of west of<br>
Athlone. The gayeties were incessant; and if good feeding, plenty
of<br>
claret, short whist, country dances, and kissing could have done
the thing,<br>
there wouldn't have been a bachelor with a red coat for six miles
around.</p>

<p>[Footnote 1: I cannot permit the reader to fall into the same
blunder,<br>
with regard to the worthy "Maurice," as my friend Charles
O'Malley has<br>
done. It is only fair to state that the doctor in the following
tale was<br>
hoaxing the "dragoon." A braver and a better fellow than Quill
never<br>
existed, equally beloved by his brother officers, as delighted in
for his<br>
convivial talents. His favorite amusement was to invent some
story or<br>
adventure in which, mixing up his own name with that of some
friend or<br>
companion, the veracity of the whole was never questioned. Of
this nature<br>
was the pedigree he devised in the last chapter of Vol. I. to
impose upon<br>
O'Malley, who believed implicitly all he told him.]</p>

<p>"You know the west, O'Mealey, so I needn't tell you what the
Galway girls<br>
are like: fine, hearty, free-and-easy, talking, laughing devils,
but as<br>
deep and 'cute as a Master in Chancery; ready for any fun or
merriment, but<br>
always keeping a sly look-out for a proposal or a tender
acknowledgment,<br>
which&mdash;what between the heat of a ball-room, whiskey negus, white
satin<br>
shoes, and a quarrel with your guardian&mdash;it's ten to one you fall
into<br>
before you're a week in the same town with them.</p>

<p>"As for the men, I don't admire them so much: pleasant and
cheerful enough<br>
when they're handicapping the coat off your back, and your new
tilbury for<br>
a spavined pony and a cotton umbrella, but regular devils if you
come to<br>
cross them the least in life; nothing but ten paces, three shots
apiece, to<br>
begin and end with something like Roger de Coverley, when every
one has a<br>
pull at his neighbor. I'm not saying they're not agreeable,
well-informed,<br>
and mild in their habits; but they lean overmuch to corduroys and
coroners'<br>
inquests for one's taste farther south. However, they're a fine
people,<br>
take them all in all; and if they were not interfered with, and
their<br>
national customs invaded with road-making, petty-sessions,
grand-jury laws,<br>
and a stray commission now and then, they are capable of great
things, and<br>
would astonish the world.</p>

<p>"But as I was saying, we were ordered to Loughrea after being
fifteen<br>
months in detachments about Birr, Tullamore, Kilbeggan, and all
that<br>
country; the change was indeed a delightful one, and we soon
found<br>
ourselves the centre of the most marked and determined
civilities. I told<br>
you they were wise people in the west; this was their
calculation: the<br>
line&mdash;ours was the Roscommon militia&mdash;are here to-day, there
to-morrow;<br>
they may be flirting in Tralee this week, and fighting on the
Tagus the<br>
next; not that there was any fighting there in those times, but
then there<br>
was always Nova Scotia and St. John's, and a hundred other places
that a<br>
Galway young lady knew nothing about, except that people never
came back<br>
from them. Now, what good, what use was there in falling in love
with them?<br>
Mere transitory and passing pleasure that was. But as for us:
there we<br>
were; if not in Kilkenny we were in Cork. Safe out and come
again; no<br>
getting away under pretence of foreign service; no excuse for not
marrying<br>
by any cruel pictures of the colonies, where they make
spatch-cocks of the<br>
officers' wives and scrape their infant families to death with a
small<br>
tooth-comb. In a word, my dear O'Mealey, we were at a high
premium; and<br>
even O'Shaughnessy, with his red head and the legs you see, had
his<br>
admirers. There now, don't be angry, Dan; the men, at least, were
mighty<br>
partial to you.</p>

<p>"Loughrea, if it was a pleasant, was a very expensive place.
White gloves<br>
and car hire,&mdash;there wasn't a chaise in the town,&mdash;short whist,
too (God<br>
forgive me if I wrong them, but I wonder were they honest), cost
money; and<br>
as our popularity rose, our purses fell; till at length, when the
one was<br>
at the flood, the other was something very like low water.</p>

<p>"Now, the Roscommon was a beautiful corps; no petty
jealousies, no little<br>
squabbling among the officers, no small spleen between the
major's wife<br>
and the paymaster's sister,&mdash;all was amiable, kind, brotherly,
and<br>
affectionate. To proceed, I need only mention one fine trait of
them,&mdash;no<br>
man ever refused to indorse a brother officer's bill. To think of
asking<br>
the amount or even the date would be taken personally; and thus
we went on<br>
mutually aiding and assisting each other,&mdash;the colonel drawing on
me, I<br>
on the major, the senior captain on the surgeon, and so on, a
regular<br>
cross-fire of 'promises to pay,' all stamped and regular.</p>

<p>"Not but the system had its inconveniences; for sometimes an
obstinate<br>
tailor or bootmaker would make a row for his money, and then we'd
be<br>
obliged to get up a little quarrel between the drawer and the
acceptor of<br>
the bill; they couldn't speak for some days, and a mutual friend
to both<br>
would tell the creditor that the slightest imprudence on his part
would<br>
lead to bloodshed; 'and the Lord help him! if there was a duel,
he'd be<br>
proved the whole cause of it.' This and twenty other plans were
employed;<br>
and finally, the matter would be left to arbitration among our
brother<br>
officers, and I need not say, they behaved like trumps. But
notwithstanding<br>
all this, we were frequently hard pressed for cash; as the
colonel said,<br>
'It's a mighty expensive corps.' Our dress was costly; not that
it had much<br>
lace and gold on it, but that, what between falling on the road
at night,<br>
shindies at mess, and other devilment, a coat lasted no time.
Wine, too,<br>
was heavy on us; for though we often changed our wine merchant,
and rarely<br>
paid him, there was an awful consumption at the mess!</p>

<p>"Now, what I have mentioned may prepare you for the fact that
before<br>
we were eight weeks in garrison, Shaugh and myself, upon an
accurate<br>
calculation of our conjoint finances, discovered that except some
vague<br>
promises of discounting here and there through the town, and
seven and<br>
fourpence in specie, we were innocent of any pecuniary treasures.
This was<br>
embarrassing; we had both embarked in several small schemes of
pleasurable<br>
amusement, had a couple of hunters each, a tandem, and a running
account&mdash;I<br>
think it <i>galloped</i>&mdash;at every shop in the town.</p>

<p>"Let me pause for a moment here, O'Mealey, while I moralize a
little in a<br>
strain I hope may benefit you. Have you ever considered&mdash;of
course you have<br>
not, you're too young and unreflecting&mdash;how beautifully every
climate<br>
and every soil possesses some one antidote or another to its own
noxious<br>
influences? The tropics have their succulent and juicy fruits,
cooling and<br>
refreshing; the northern latitudes have their beasts with fur and
warm skin<br>
to keep out the frost-bites; and so it is in Ireland. Nowhere on
the face<br>
of the habitable globe does a man contract such habits of small
debt, and<br>
nowhere, I'll be sworn, can he so easily get out of any scrape
concerning<br>
them. They have their tigers in the east, their antelopes in the
south,<br>
their white bears in Norway, their buffaloes in America; but we
have an<br>
animal in Ireland that beats them all hollow,&mdash;a country
attorney!</p>

<p>"Now, let me introduce you to Mr. Matthew Donevan. Mat, as he
was<br>
familiarly called by his numerous acquaintances, was a short,
florid, rosy<br>
little gentleman of some four or five-and-forty, with a
well-curled wig of<br>
the fairest imaginable auburn, the gentle wave of the front
locks, which<br>
played in infantine loveliness upon his little bullet forehead,
contrasting<br>
strongly enough with a cunning leer of his eye, and a certain
<i>nisi prius</i><br>
laugh that however it might please a client, rarely brought
pleasurable<br>
feelings to his opponent in a cause.</p>

<p>"Mat was a character in his way; deep, double, and tricky in
everything<br>
that concerned his profession, he affected the gay fellow,&mdash;liked
a jolly<br>
dinner at Brown's Hotel, would go twenty miles to see a
steeple-chase and<br>
a coursing match, bet with any one when the odds were strong in
his favor,<br>
with an easy indifference about money that made him seem, when
winning,<br>
rather the victim of good luck than anything else. As he kept a
rather<br>
pleasant bachelor's house, and liked the military much, we soon
became<br>
acquainted. Upon him, therefore, for reasons I can't explain,
both our<br>
hopes reposed; and Shaugh and myself at once agreed that if Mat
could not<br>
assist us in our distresses, the case was a bad one.</p>

<p>"A pretty little epistle was accordingly concocted, inviting
the worthy<br>
attorney to a small dinner at five o'clock the next day,
intimating that we<br>
were to be perfectly alone, and had a little business to discuss.
True to<br>
the hour, Mat was there; and as if instantly guessing that ours
was no<br>
regular party of pleasure, his look, dress, and manner were all
in keeping<br>
with the occasion,&mdash;quiet, subdued, and searching.</p>

<p>"When the claret had been superseded by the whiskey, and the
confidential<br>
hours were approaching, by an adroit allusion to some heavy wager
then<br>
pending, we brought our finances upon the <i>tapis</i>. The thing was
done<br>
beautifully,&mdash;an easy <i>adagio</i> movement, no violent transition;
but hang me<br>
if old Mat didn't catch the matter at once.</p>

<p>"'Oh, it's there ye are, Captain!' said he, with his peculiar
grin.<br>
'Two-and-sixpence in the pound, and no assets.'</p>

<p>"'The last is nearer the mark, my old boy,' said Shaugh,
blurting out the<br>
whole truth at once. The wily attorney finished his tumbler
slowly, as<br>
if giving himself time for reflection, and then, smacking his
lips in a<br>
preparatory manner, took a quick survey of the room with his
piercing green<br>
eye.</p>

<p>"'A very sweet mare of yours that little mouse-colored one is,
with the dip<br>
in the back; and she has a trifling curb&mdash;may be it's a spavin,
indeed&mdash;in<br>
the near hind-leg. You gave five-and-twenty for her, now, I'll be
bound?'</p>

<p>"'Sixty guineas, as sure as my name's Dan,' said Shaugh, not
at all pleased<br>
at the value put upon his hackney; 'and as to spavin and curb,
I'll wager<br>
double the sum she has neither the slightest trace of one nor the
other.'</p>

<p>"'I'll not take the bet,' said Mat, dryly. 'Money's scarce in
these parts.'</p>

<p>"This hit silenced us both; and our friend continued,&mdash;</p>

<p>"'Then there's the bay horse,&mdash;a great strapping, leggy beast
he is for a<br>
tilbury; and the hunters, worth nothing here; they don't know
this country.<br>
Them's neat pistols; and the tilbury is not bad&mdash;'</p>

<p>"'Confound you!' said I, losing all patience; 'we didn't ask
you here to<br>
appraise our movables. We want to raise the wind without
that.'</p>

<p>"'I see, I perceive,' said Mat, taking a pinch of snuff very
leisurely as<br>
he spoke,&mdash;'I see. Well, that is difficult, very difficult just
now. I've<br>
mortgaged every acre of ground in the two counties near us, and a
sixpence<br>
more is not to be had that way. Are you lucky at the races?'</p>

<p>"'Never win a sixpence.'</p>

<p>"'What can you do at whist?'</p>

<p>"'Revoke, and get cursed by my partner; devil a more!'</p>

<p>"'That's mighty bad, for otherwise, we might arrange something
for you.<br>
Well, I only see one thing for it; you must marry. A wife with
some money<br>
will get you out of your present difficulties; and we'll manage
that easily<br>
enough.'</p>

<p>"'Come, Dan,' said I, for Shaugh was dropping asleep; 'cheer
up, old<br>
fellow. Donevan has found the way to pull us through our
misfortunes. A<br>
girl with forty thousand pounds, the best cock shooting in
Ireland, an old<br>
family, a capital cellar, all await ye,&mdash;rouse up, there!'</p>

<p>"'I'm convanient,' said Shaugh, with a look intended to be
knowing, but<br>
really very tipsy.</p>

<p>"'I didn't say much for her personal attractions, Captain,'
said Mat; 'nor,<br>
indeed, did I specify the exact sum; but Mrs. Rogers Dooley, of
Clonakilty,<br>
might be a princess&mdash;'</p>

<p>"'And so she shall be, Mat; the O'Shaughnessys were Kings of
Ennis in the<br>
time of Nero and I'm only waiting for a trifle of money to revive
the<br>
title. What's her name?'</p>

<p>"'Mrs. Rogers Dooley.'</p>

<p>"'Here's her health, and long life to her,&mdash;</p>

<p>    'And may the Devil cut the toes<br>
    Of all her foes,<br>
    That we may know them by their limping.'</p>

<p>"This benevolent wish uttered, Dan fell flat upon the
hearth-rug, and was<br>
soon sound asleep. I must hasten on; so need only say that,
before we<br>
parted that night, Mat and myself had finished the half-gallon
bottle of<br>
Loughrea whiskey, and concluded a treaty for the hand and fortune
of Mrs.<br>
Rogers Dooley. He being guaranteed a very handsome percentage on
the<br>
property, and the lady being reserved for choice between Dan and
myself,<br>
which, however, I was determined should fall upon my more
fortunate friend.</p>

<p>"The first object which presented itself to my aching senses
the following<br>
morning was a very spacious card of invitation from Mr. Jonas
Malone,<br>
requesting me to favor him with the seductions of my society the
next<br>
evening to a ball; at the bottom of which, in Mr. Donevan's hand,
I read,&mdash;</p>

<p>"'Don't fail; you know who is to be there. I've not been idle
since I saw<br>
you. Would the captain take twenty-five for the mare?'</p>

<p>"'So far so good,' thought I, as entering O'Shaughnessy's
quarters, I<br>
discovered him endeavoring to spell out his card, which, however,
had no<br>
postscript. We soon agreed that Mat should have his price; so
sending a<br>
polite answer to the invitation, we despatched a still more civil
note to<br>
the attorney, and begged of him, as a weak mark of esteem, to
accept the<br>
mouse-colored mare as a present."</p>

<p>Here O'Shaughnessy sighed deeply, and even seemed affected by
the souvenir.</p>

<p>"Come, Dan, we did it all for the best. Oh, O'Mealey, he was a
cunning<br>
fellow; but no matter. We went to the ball, and to be sure, it
was a great<br>
sight. Two hundred and fifty souls, where there was not good room
for the<br>
odd fifty; such laughing, such squeezing, such pressing of hands
and waists<br>
in the staircase, and then such a row and riot at the top,&mdash;four
fiddles, a<br>
key bugle, and a bagpipe, playing 'Haste to the wedding,' amidst
the crash<br>
of refreshment-trays, the tramp of feet, and the sounds of
merriment on all<br>
sides!</p>

<p>"It's only in Ireland, after all, people have fun. Old and
young, merry and<br>
morose, the gay and cross-grained, are crammed into a lively
country-dance;<br>
and ill-matched, ill-suited, go jigging away together to the
blast of a bad<br>
band, till their heads, half turned by the noise, the heat, the
novelty,<br>
and the hubbub, they all get as tipsy as if they were really deep
in<br>
liquor.</p>

<p>"Then there is that particularly free-and-easy tone in every
one about.<br>
Here go a couple capering daintily out of the ball-room to take a
little<br>
fresh air on the stairs, where every step has its own separate
flirtation<br>
party; there, a riotous old gentleman, with a boarding-school
girl for<br>
his partner, has plunged smack into a party at loo, upsetting
cards and<br>
counters, and drawing down curses innumerable. Here are a merry
knot round<br>
the refreshments, and well they may be; for the negus is strong
punch,<br>
and the biscuit is tipsy cake,&mdash;and all this with a running fire
of good<br>
stories, jokes, and witticisms on all sides, in the laughter for
which even<br>
the droll-looking servants join as heartily as the rest.</p>

<p>"We were not long in finding out Mrs. Rogers, who sat in the
middle of a<br>
very high sofa, with her feet just touching the floor. She was
short,<br>
fat, wore her hair in a crop, had a species of shining yellow
skin, and a<br>
turned-up nose, all of which were by no means prepossessing.
Shaugh and<br>
myself were too hard-up to be particular, and so we invited her
to dance<br>
alternately for two consecutive hours, plying her assiduously
with negus<br>
during the lulls in the music.</p>

<p>"Supper was at last announced, and enabled us to recruit for
new efforts;<br>
and so after an awful consumption of fowl, pigeon-pie, ham, and
brandy<br>
cherries, Mrs. Rogers brightened up considerably, and professed
her<br>
willingness to join the dancers. As for us, partly from
exhaustion, partly<br>
to stimulate our energies, and in some degree to drown
reflection, we drank<br>
deep, and when we reached the drawing-room, not only the
agreeable guests<br>
themselves, but even the furniture, the venerable chairs, and the
stiff old<br>
sofa seemed performing 'Sir Roger de Coverley.' How we conducted
ourselves<br>
till five in the morning, let our cramps confess; for we were
both<br>
bed-ridden for ten days after. However, at last Mrs. Rogers gave
in, and<br>
reclining gracefully upon a window-seat, pronounced it a most
elegant<br>
party, and asked me to look for her shawl. While I perambulated
the<br>
staircase with her bonnet on my head, and more wearing apparel
than would<br>
stock a magazine, Shaugh was roaring himself hoarse in the
street, calling<br>
Mrs. Rogers' coach.</p>

<p>"'Sure, Captain,' said the lady, with a tender leer, 'it's
only a chair.'</p>

<p>"'And here it is,' said I, surveying a very portly-looking old
sedan, newly<br>
painted and varnished, that blocked up half the hall.</p>

<p>"'You'll catch cold, my angel,' said Shaugh, in a whisper, for
he was<br>
coming it very strong by this; 'get into the chair. Maurice,
can't you find<br>
those fellows?' said he to me, for the chairmen had gone
down-stairs, and<br>
were making very merry among the servants.</p>

<p>"'She's fast now,' said I, shutting the door to. 'Let us do
the gallant<br>
thing, and carry her home ourselves.' Shaugh thought this a great
notion;<br>
and in a minute we mounted the poles and sallied forth, amidst a
great<br>
chorus of laughing from all the footmen, maids, and teaboys that
filled the<br>
passage.</p>

<p>"'The big house, with the bow-window and the pillars,
Captain,' said a<br>
fellow, as we issued upon our journey. "'I know it,' said I.
'Turn to the<br>
left after you pass the square.'</p>

<p>"'Isn't she heavy?' said Shaugh, as he meandered across the
narrow streets<br>
with a sidelong motion that must have suggested to our fair
inside<br>
passenger some notions of a sea voyage. In truth, I must confess
our<br>
progress was rather a devious one,&mdash;now zig-zagging from side to
side, now<br>
getting into a sharp trot, and then suddenly pulling up at a dead
stop, or<br>
running the machine chuck against a wall, to enable us to stand
still and<br>
gain breath.</p>

<p>"'Which way now?' cried he, as we swung round the angle of a
street and<br>
entered the large market-place; 'I'm getting terribly tired.'</p>

<p>"'Never give in, Dan. Think of Clonakilty and the old lady
herself.' Here<br>
I gave the chair a hoist that evidently astonished our fair
friend, for a<br>
very imploring cry issued forth immediately after.</p>

<p>"'To the right, quick-step, forward, charge!' cried I; and we
set off at a<br>
brisk trot down a steep narrow lane.</p>

<p>"'Here it is now,&mdash;the light in the window. Cheer up.'</p>

<p>"As I said this we came short up to a fine, portly-looking
doorway, with<br>
great stone pillars and cornice.</p>

<p>"'Make yourself at home, Maurice,' said he; 'bring her in.' So
saying,<br>
we pushed forward&mdash;for the door was open&mdash;and passed boldly into
a great<br>
flagged hall, silent and cold, and dark as the night itself.</p>

<p>"'Are you sure we're right?' said he.</p>

<p>"'All right,' said I; 'go ahead.'</p>

<p>"And so we did, till we came in sight of a small candle that
burned dimly<br>
at a distance from us.</p>

<p>"'Make for the light,' said I; but just as I said so Shaugh
slipped and<br>
fell flat on the flagway. The noise of his fall sent up a hundred
echoes<br>
in the silent building, and terrified us both dreadfully. After a
minute's<br>
pause, by one consent we turned and made for the door, falling
almost at<br>
every step, and frightened out of our senses, we came tumbling
together<br>
into the porch, and out in the street, and never drew breath till
we<br>
reached the barracks. Meanwhile let me return to Mrs. Rogers. The
dear<br>
old lady, who had passed an awful time since she left the ball,
had just<br>
rallied out of a fainting fit when we took to our heels; so after
screaming<br>
and crying her best, she at last managed to open the top of the
chair, and<br>
by dint of great exertions succeeded in forcing the door, and at
length<br>
freed herself from bondage. She was leisurely groping her way
round it<br>
in the dark, when her lamentations, being heard without, woke up
the old<br>
sexton of the chapel,&mdash;for it was there we placed her,&mdash;who,
entering<br>
cautiously with a light, no sooner caught a glimpse of the great
black<br>
sedan and the figure beside it than he also took to his heels,
and ran like<br>
a madman to the priest's house.</p>

<p>"'Come, your reverence, come, for the love of marcy! Sure
didn't I see him<br>
myself! Oh, wirra, wirra!'</p>

<p>"'What is it, ye ould fool?' said M'Kenny.</p>

<p>"'It's Father Con Doran, your reverence, that was buried last
week, and<br>
there he is up now, coffin and all, saying a midnight Mass as
lively as<br>
ever.'</p>

<p>"Poor Mrs. Rogers, God help her! It was a trying sight for her
when the<br>
priest and the two coadjutors and three little boys and the
sexton all came<br>
in to lay her spirit; and the shock she received that night, they
say, she<br>
never got over.</p>

<p>"Need I say, my dear O'Mealey, that our acquaintance with Mrs.
Rogers was<br>
closed? The dear woman had a hard struggle for it afterwards. Her
character<br>
was assailed by all the elderly ladies in Loughrea for going off
in our<br>
company, and her blue satin, piped with scarlet, utterly ruined
by a deluge<br>
of holy water bestowed on her by the pious sexton. It was in vain
that she<br>
originated twenty different reports to mystify the world; and
even ten<br>
pounds spent in Masses for the eternal repose of Father Con Doran
only<br>
increased the laughter this unfortunate affair gave rise to. As
for us, we<br>
exchanged into the line, and foreign service took us out of the
road of<br>
duns, debts, and devilment, and we soon reformed, and eschewed
such low<br>
company."</p>

<p>The day was breaking ere we separated; and amidst the rich and
fragrant<br>
vapors that exhaled from the earth, the faint traces of sunlight
dimly<br>
stealing told of the morning. My two friends set out for
Torrijos, and I<br>
pushed boldly forward in the direction of the Alberche.</p>

<p>It was a strange thing that although but two days before the
roads we were<br>
then travelling had been the line of retreat of the whole French
army, not<br>
a vestige of their equipment nor a trace of their
<i>mat&eacute;riel</i> had been left<br>
behind. In vain we searched each thicket by the wayside for some
straggling<br>
soldier, some wounded or wearied man; nothing of the kind was to
be seen.<br>
Except the deeply-rutted road, torn by the heavy wheels of the
artillery,<br>
and the white ashes of a wood fire, nothing marked their
progress.</p>

<p>Our journey was a lonely one. Not a man was to be met with.
The houses<br>
stood untenanted; the doors lay open; no smoke wreathed from
their deserted<br>
hearths. The peasantry had taken to the mountains; and although
the plains<br>
were yellow with the ripe harvest, and the peaches hung
temptingly upon the<br>
trees, all was deserted and forsaken. I had often seen the
blackened walls<br>
and broken rafters, the traces of the wild revenge and reckless
pillage of<br>
a retiring army. The ruined castle and the desecrated altar are
sad things<br>
to look upon; but, somehow, a far heavier depression sunk into my
heart<br>
as my eye ranged over the wide valleys and broad hills, all
redolent of<br>
comfort, of beauty, and of happiness, and yet not one man to say,
"This is<br>
my home; these are my household gods." The birds carolled gayly
in each<br>
leafy thicket; the bright stream sung merrily as it rippled
through the<br>
rocks; the tall corn, gently stirred by the breeze, seemed to
swell the<br>
concert of sweet sounds; but no human voice awoke the echoes
there. It<br>
was as if the earth was speaking in thankfulness to its Maker,
while<br>
man,&mdash;ungrateful and unworthy man,&mdash;pursuing his ruthless path
of<br>
devastation and destruction, had left no being to say, "I thank
Thee for<br>
all these."</p>

<p>The day was closing as we drew near the Alberche, and came in
sight of the<br>
watch-fires of the enemy. Far as the eye could reach their column
extended,<br>
but in the dim twilight nothing could be seen with accuracy; yet
from the<br>
position their artillery occupied, and the unceasing din of
baggage wagons<br>
and heavy carriages towards the rear, I came to the conclusion
that a still<br>
farther retreat was meditated. A picket of light cavalry was
posted upon<br>
the river's bank, and seemed to watch with vigilance the
approaches to the<br>
stream.</p>

<p>Our bivouac was a dense copse of pine-trees, exactly opposite
to the French<br>
advanced posts, and there we passed the night,&mdash;fortunately a
calm and<br>
starlight one; for we dared not light fires, fearful of
attracting<br>
attention.</p>

<p>During the long hours I lay patiently watching the movements
of the enemy<br>
till the dark shadows hid all from sight; and even then, as my
ears caught<br>
the challenge of a sentry or the footsteps of some officer in his
round,<br>
my thoughts were riveted upon them, and a hundred vague fancies
as to the<br>
future were based upon no stronger foundation than the clink of a
firelock<br>
or the low-muttered song of a patrol.</p>

<p>Towards morning I slept; and when day broke my first glance
was towards the<br>
river-side. But the French were gone, noiselessly, rapidly. Like
one man<br>
that vast army had departed, and a dense column of dust towards
the<br>
horizon alone marked the long line of march where the martial
legions were<br>
retreating.</p>

<p>My mission was thus ended; and hastily partaking of the humble
breakfast my<br>
friend Mike provided for me, I once more set out and took the
road towards<br>
headquarters.</p>

<br><br><br><br><p>CHAPTER II.</p>

<p>THE SKIRMISH.</p>

<p>For several months after the battle of Talavera my life
presented nothing<br>
which I feel worth recording. Our good fortune seemed to have
deserted us<br>
when our hopes were highest; for from the day of that splendid
victory we<br>
began our retrograde movement upon Portugal. Pressed hard by
overwhelming<br>
masses of the enemy, we saw the fortresses of Ciudad Rodrigo and
Almeida<br>
fall successively into their hands. The Spaniards were defeated
wherever<br>
they ventured upon a battle; and our own troops, thinned by
sickness and<br>
desertion, presented but a shadow of that brilliant army which
only a few<br>
months previous had followed the retiring French beyond the
frontiers of<br>
Portugal.</p>

<p>However willing I now am&mdash;and who is not&mdash;to recognize the
genius and<br>
foresight of that great man who then held the destinies of the
Peninsula<br>
within his hands, I confess at the time I speak of I could ill
comprehend<br>
and still less feel contented with the successive retreats our
forces made;<br>
and while the words Torres Vedras brought nothing to my mind but
the last<br>
resting-place before embarkation, the sad fortunes of Corunna
were now<br>
before me, and it was with a gloomy and desponding spirit I
followed the<br>
routine of my daily duty.</p>

<p>During these weary months, if my life was devoid of stirring
interest or<br>
adventure, it was not profitless. Constantly employed at the
outposts,<br>
I became thoroughly inured to all the roughing of a soldier's
life, and<br>
learned in the best of schools that tacit obedience which alone
can form<br>
the subordinate or ultimately fit its possessor for command
himself.</p>

<p>Humble and unobtrusive as such a career must ever be, it was
not without<br>
its occasional rewards. From General Crawfurd I more than once
obtained<br>
most kind mention in his despatches, and felt that I was not
unknown or<br>
unnoticed by Sir Arthur Wellesley himself. At that time these
testimonies,<br>
slight and passing as they were, contributed to the pride and
glory of my<br>
existence; and even now&mdash;shall I confess it?&mdash;when some gray
hairs are<br>
mingling with the brown, and when my old dragoon swagger is
taming down<br>
into a kind of half-pay shamble, I feel my heart warm at the
recollection<br>
of them.</p>

<p>Be it so; I care not who smiles at the avowal. I know of
little better<br>
worth remembering as we grow old than what pleased us while we
were young.<br>
With the memory of the kind words once spoken come back the still
kinder<br>
looks of those who spoke them, and better than all, that early
feeling of<br>
budding manhood, when there was neither fear nor distrust. Alas!
these are<br>
the things, and not weak eyes and tottering limbs, which form the
burden of<br>
old age. Oh, if we could only go on believing, go on trusting, go
on hoping<br>
to the last, who would shed tears for the bygone feats of his
youthful<br>
days, when the spirit that evoked them lived young and vivid as
before?</p>

<p>But to my story. While Ciudad Rodrigo still held out against
the besieging<br>
French,&mdash;its battered walls and breached ramparts sadly
foretelling the<br>
fate inevitably impending,&mdash;we were ordered, together with the
16th Light<br>
Dragoons, to proceed to Gallegos, to reinforce Crawfurd's
division, then<br>
forming a corps of observation upon Massena's movements.</p>

<p>The position he occupied was a most commanding one,&mdash;the crown
of a long<br>
mountain ridge, studded with pine-copse and cork-trees,
presenting every<br>
facility for light-infantry movements; and here and there gently
sloping<br>
towards the plain, offering a field for cavalry manoeuvres.
Beneath, in<br>
the vast plain, were encamped the dark legions of France, their
heavy<br>
siege-artillery planted against the doomed fortress, while clouds
of their<br>
cavalry caracoled proudly before us, as if in taunting sarcasm at
our<br>
inactivity.</p>

<p>Every artifice which his natural cunning could suggest, every
taunt a<br>
Frenchman's vocabulary contains, had been used by Massena to
induce Sir<br>
Arthur Wellesley to come to the assistance of the beleagured
fortress:<br>
but in vain. In vain he relaxed the energy of the siege, and
affected<br>
carelessness. In vain he asserted that the English were either
afraid or<br>
else traitors to their allies. The mind of him he thus assailed
was neither<br>
accessible to menace nor to sarcasm. Patiently abiding his time,
he watched<br>
the progress of events, and provided for that future which was to
crown his<br>
country's arms with success and himself with undying glory.</p>

<p>Of a far different mettle was the general formed under whose
orders we were<br>
now placed. Hot, passionate, and impetuous, relying upon bold and
headlong<br>
heroism rather than upon cool judgment and well-matured plans,
Crawfurd<br>
felt in war all the asperity and bitterness of a personal
conflict. Ill<br>
brooking the insulting tone of the wily Frenchman, he thirsted
for any<br>
occasion of a battle, and his proud spirit chafed against the
colder<br>
counsels of his superior.</p>

<p>On the very morning we joined, the pickets brought in the
intelligence that<br>
the French patrols were nightly in the habit of visiting the
villages at<br>
the outposts and committing every species of cruel indignity upon
the<br>
wretched inhabitants. Fired at this daring insult, our general
resolved to<br>
cut them off, and formed two ambuscades for the purpose.</p>

<p>Six squadrons of the 14th were despatched to Villa del Puerco,
three of<br>
the 16th to Baguetto, while some companies of the 95th, and the
ca&ccedil;adores,<br>
supported by artillery, were ordered to hold themselves in
reserve, for the<br>
enemy were in force at no great distance from us.</p>

<p>The morning was just breaking as an aide-de-camp galloped up
with the<br>
intelligence that the French had been seen near the Villa del
Puerco, a<br>
body of infantry and some cavalry having crossed the plain, and
disappeared<br>
in that direction. While our colonel was forming us, with the
intention of<br>
getting between them and their main body, the tramp of horses was
heard in<br>
the wood behind, and in a few moments two officers rode up. The
foremost,<br>
who was a short, stoutly-built man of about forty, with a bronzed
face and<br>
eye of piercing black, shouted out as we wheeled into
column:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Halt, there! Why, where the devil are you going? That's your
ground!" So<br>
saying, and pointing straight towards the village with his hand,
he would<br>
not listen to our colonel's explanation that several stone fences
and<br>
enclosures would interfere with cavalry movements, but added,
"Forward, I<br>
say! Proceed!"</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the nature of the ground separated our
squadron, as the<br>
colonel anticipated; and although we came on at a topping pace,
the French<br>
had time to form in square upon a hill to await us, and when we
charged,<br>
they stood firmly, and firing with a low and steady aim, several
of our<br>
troopers fell. As we wheeled round, we found ourselves exactly in
front<br>
of their cavalry coming out of Baguilles; so dashing straight at
them,<br>
we revenged ourselves for our first repulse by capturing
twenty-nine<br>
prisoners, and wounding several others.</p>

<p>The French infantry were, however, still unbroken; and Colonel
Talbot rode<br>
boldly up with five squadrons of the 14th; but the charge,
pressed home<br>
with all its gallantry, failed also, and the colonel fell
mortally wounded,<br>
and fourteen of his troopers around him. Twice we rode round the
square,<br>
seeking for a weak point, but in vain; the gallant Frenchman who
commanded,<br>
Captain Guache, stood fearlessly amidst his brave followers, and
we could<br>
hear him, as he called out from time to time,&mdash;</p>

<p>"<i>C'est &ccedil;a mes enfans! Tr&eacute;s bien fait, mes
braves!</i>"</p>

<p>And at length they made good their retreat, while we returned
to the camp,<br>
leaving thirty-two troopers and our brave colonel dead upon the
field in<br>
this disastrous affair.</p>

<p>The repulse we had met with, so contrary to all our hopes and
expectations,<br>
made that a most gloomy day to all of us. The brave fellows we
had left<br>
behind us, the taunting cheer of the French infantry, the
unbroken ranks<br>
against which we rode time after time in vain, never left our
minds; and a<br>
sense of shame of what might be thought of us at headquarters
rendered the<br>
reflection still more painful.</p>

<p>Our bivouac, notwithstanding all our efforts, was a sad one,
and when the<br>
moon rose, some drops of heavy rain falling at intervals in the
still,<br>
unruffled air threatened a night of storm; gradually the sky grew
darker<br>
and darker, the clouds hung nearer to the earth, and a dense,
thick mass<br>
of dark mist shrouded every object. The heavy cannonade of the
siege was<br>
stilled; nothing betrayed that a vast army was encamped near us;
their<br>
bivouac fires were even imperceptible; and the only sound we
heard was the<br>
great bell of Ciudad Rodrigo as it struck the hour, and seemed,
in the<br>
mournful cadence of its chime, like the knell of the doomed
citadel.</p>

<p>The patrol which I commanded had to visit on its rounds the
most advanced<br>
post of our position. This was a small farm-house, which,
standing upon a<br>
little rising ledge of ground, was separated from the French
lines by a<br>
little stream tributary to the Aguda. A party of the 14th were
picketed<br>
here, and beneath them in the valley, scarce five hundred yards
distant,<br>
was the detachment of cuirassiers which formed the French
outpost. As we<br>
neared our picket the deep voice of the sentry challenged us; and
while<br>
all else was silent as the grave, we could hear from the opposite
side<br>
the merry chorus of a French <i>chanson &agrave; boire</i>, with its
clattering<br>
accompaniment of glasses, as some gay companions were making
merry<br>
together.</p>

<p>Within the little hut which contained <i>our</i> fellows, the scene
was a<br>
different one. The three officers who commanded sat moodily over
a wretched<br>
fire of wet wood; a solitary candle dimly lighted the dismantled
room,<br>
where a table but ill-supplied with cheer stood unminded and
uncared for.</p>

<p>"Well, O'Malley," cried Baker, as I came in, "what is the
night about? And<br>
what's Crawfurd for next?"</p>

<p>"We hear," cried another, "that he means to give battle
to-morrow; but<br>
surely Sir Arthur's orders are positive enough. Gordon himself
told me<br>
that he was forbidden to fight beyond the Coa, but to retreat at
the first<br>
advance of the enemy."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid," replied I, "that retreating is his last thought
just now.<br>
Ammunition has just been served out, and I know the horse
artillery have<br>
orders to be in readiness by daybreak."</p>

<p>"All right," said Hampden, with a half-bitter tone. "Nothing
like going<br>
through with it. If he is to be brought to court-martial for
disobedience,<br>
he'll take good care we sha'n't be there to see it."</p>

<p>"Why, the French are fifty thousand strong!" said Baker. "Look
there, what<br>
does that mean, now? That's a signal from the town."</p>

<p>As he spoke a rocket of great brilliancy shot up into the sky,
and bursting<br>
at length fell in millions of red lustrous sparks on every side,
showing<br>
forth the tall fortress, and the encamped army around it, with
all the<br>
clearness of noonday. It was a most splendid sight; and though
the next<br>
moment all was dark as before, we gazed still fixedly into the
gloomy<br>
distance, straining our eyes to observe what was hid from our
view forever.</p>

<p>"That must be a signal," repeated Baker.</p>

<p>"Begad! if Crawfurd sees it he'll interpret it as a reason for
fighting. I<br>
trust he's asleep by this time," said Hampden. "By-the-bye,
O'Malley, did<br>
you see the fellows at work in the trenches? How beautifully
clear it was<br>
towards the southward!"</p>

<p>"Yes, I remarked that! and what surprised me was the openness
of their<br>
position in that direction. Towards the San Benito mole I could
not see a<br>
man."</p>

<p>"Ah, they'll not attack on that side; but if we really
are&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Stay, Hampden!" said I, interrupting him, "a thought has just
struck me.<br>
At sunset, I saw, through my telescope, the French engineers
marking with<br>
their white tape the line of a new entrenchment in that quarter.
Would it<br>
not be a glorious thing to move the tape, and bring the fellows
under the<br>
fire of San Benito?"</p>

<p>"By Jove, O'Malley, that is a thought worth a troop to
you!"</p>

<p>"Far more likely to forward his promotion in the next world
than in this,"<br>
said Baker, smiling.</p>

<p>"By no means," added I. "I marked the ground this evening, and
have it<br>
perfectly in my mind. If we were to follow the bend of the river,
I'll be<br>
bound to come right upon the spot; by nearing the fortress we'll
escape the<br>
sentries; and all this portion is open to us."</p>

<p>The project thus loosely thrown out was now discussed in all
its bearings.<br>
Whatever difficulties it presented were combated so much to our
own<br>
satisfaction, that at last its very facility damped our ardor.
Meanwhile<br>
the night wore on, and the storm of rain so long impending began
to descend<br>
in very torrents; hissing along the parched ground, it rose in a
mist,<br>
while overhead the heavy thunder rolled in long unbroken peals;
the crazy<br>
door threatened to give way at each moment, and the whole
building trembled<br>
to its foundation.</p>

<p>"Pass the brandy down here, Hampden, and thank your stars
you're where you<br>
are. Eh, O'Malley? You'll defer your trip to San Benito for finer
weather."</p>

<p>"Well, to come to the point," said Hampden, "I'd rather begin
my<br>
engineering at a more favorable season; but if O'Malley's for
it&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And O'Malley <i>is</i> for it," said I, suddenly.</p>

<p>"Then faith, I'm not the man to balk his fancy; and as
Crawfurd is so bent<br>
upon fighting to-morrow, it don't make much difference. Is it a
bargain?"</p>

<p>"It is; here's my hand on it."</p>

<p>"Come, come, boys, I'll have none of this; we've been prettily
cut up this<br>
morning already. You shall not go upon this foolish
excursion."</p>

<p>"Confound it, old fellow! it's all very well for you to talk,
with the<br>
majority before you, next step; but here we are, if peace came
to-morrow,<br>
scarcely better than we left England. No, no; if O'Malley's
ready&mdash;and I<br>
see he is so before me&mdash;What have you got there? Oh, I see;
that's our tape<br>
line; capital fun, by George! The worst of it is, they'll make us
colonels<br>
of engineers. Now then, what's your plan&mdash;on foot or
mounted?"</p>

<p>"Mounted, and for this reason, the country is all open; if we
are to have a<br>
run for it, our thoroughbreds ought to distance them; and as we
must expect<br>
to pass some of their sentries, our only chance is on
horseback."</p>

<p>"My mind is relieved of a great load," said Hampden; "I was
trembling in my<br>
skin lest you should make it a walking party. I'll do anything
you like in<br>
the saddle, from robbing the mail to cutting out a frigate; but I
never was<br>
much of a foot-pad."</p>

<p>"Well, Mike," said I, as I returned to the room with my trusty
follower,<br>
"are the cattle to be depended on?"</p>

<p>"If we had a snaffle in Malachi Daly's mouth [my brown horse],
I'd be<br>
afeared of nothing, sir; but if it comes to fencing, with that
cruel<br>
bit,&mdash;but sure, you've a light hand, and let him have his head,
if it's<br>
wall."</p>

<p>"By Jove, he thinks it a fox-chase!" said Hampden.</p>

<p>"Isn't it the same, sir?" said Mike, with a seriousness that
made the whole<br>
party smile.</p>

<p>"Well, I hope we shall not be earthed, any way," said I. "Now,
the next<br>
thing is, who has a lantern? Ah! the very thing; nothing better.
Look to<br>
your pistols, Hampden; and Mike, here's a glass of grog for you;
we'll want<br>
you. And now, one bumper for good luck. Eh, Baker, won't you
pledge us?"</p>

<p>"And spare a little for me," said Hampden. "How it does rain!
If one didn't<br>
expect to be water-proofed before morning, one really wouldn't go
out in<br>
such weather."</p>

<p>While I busied myself in arranging my few preparations,
Hampden proceeded<br>
gravely to inform Mike that we were going to the assistance of
the besieged<br>
fortress, which could not possibly go on without us.</p>

<p>"Tare and ages!" said Mike, "that's mighty quare; and the blue
rocket was a<br>
letter of invitation, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"Exactly," said Hampden; "and you see there's no ceremony
between us. We'll<br>
just drop in, in the evening, in a friendly way."</p>

<p>"Well, then, upon my conscience, I'd wait, if I was you, till
the family<br>
wasn't in confusion. They have enough on their hands just
now."</p>

<p>"So you'll not be persuaded?" said Baker. "Well, I frankly
tell you, that<br>
come what will of it, as your senior officer I'll report you
to-morrow.<br>
I'll not risk myself for any such hair-brained expeditions."</p>

<p>"A mighty pleasant look-out for me," said Mike; "if I'm not
shot to-night,<br>
I may be flogged in the morning."</p>

<p>This speech once more threw us into a hearty fit of laughter,
amidst which<br>
we took leave of our friends, and set forth upon our way.</p>

<br><br><br><br><p>CHAPTER III.</p>

<p>THE LINES OF CIUDAD RODRIGO.</p>

<p>The small, twinkling lights which shone from the ramparts of
Ciudad Rodrigo<br>
were our only guide, as we issued forth upon our perilous
expedition. The<br>
storm raged, if possible, even more violently than before, and
gusts of<br>
wind swept along the ground with the force of a hurricane; so
that at<br>
first, our horses could scarcely face the tempest. Our path lay
along the<br>
little stream for a considerable way; after which, fording the
rivulet, we<br>
entered upon the open plain, taking care to avoid the French
outpost on the<br>
extreme left, which was marked by a bivouac fire, burning under
the heavy<br>
downpour of rain, and looking larger through the dim atmosphere
around it.</p>

<p>I rode foremost, followed closely by Hampden and Mike; not a
word was<br>
spoken after we crossed the stream. Our plan was, if challenged
by a<br>
patrol, to reply in French and press on; so small a party could
never<br>
suggest the idea of attack, and we hoped in this manner to
escape.</p>

<p>The violence of the storm was such that many of our
precautions as to<br>
silence were quite unnecessary; and we had advanced to a
considerable<br>
extent into the plain before any appearance of the encampment
struck us.<br>
At length, on mounting a little rising ground, we perceived
several fires<br>
stretching far away to the northward; while still to our left,
there blazed<br>
one larger and brighter than the others. We now found that we had
not<br>
outflanked their position as we intended, and learning from the
situation<br>
of the fires, that we were still only at the outposts, we pressed
sharply<br>
forward, directing our course by the twin stars that shone from
the<br>
fortress.</p>

<p>"How heavy the ground is here!" whispered Hampden, as our
horses sunk above<br>
the fetlocks. "We had better stretch away to the right; the rise
of the<br>
hill will favor us."</p>

<p>"Hark!" said I; "did you not hear something? Pull up,&mdash;silence
now. Yes,<br>
there they come. It's a patrol; I hear their tramp." As I spoke,
the<br>
measured tread of infantry was heard above the storm, and soon
after a<br>
lantern was seen coming along the causeway near us. The column
passed<br>
within a few yards of where we stood. I could even recognize the
black<br>
covering of the shakos as the light fell on them. "Let us follow
them,"<br>
whispered I; and the next moment we fell in upon their track,
holding our<br>
cattle well in hand, and ready to start at a moment.</p>

<p>"<i>Qui va l&agrave;?</i>" a sentry demanded.</p>

<p>"<i>La deuxi&egrave;me division</i>," cried a hoarse voice.</p>

<p>"<i>Halte l&agrave;! la consigne?</i>"</p>

<p>"<i>Wagram!</i>" repeated the same voice as before, while his party
resumed<br>
their march; and the next moment the patrol was again upon his
post, silent<br>
and motionless as before.</p>

<p>"<i>En avant, Messieurs!</i>" said I, aloud, as soon as the
infantry had<br>
proceeded some distance,&mdash;"<i>en avant!</i>"</p>

<p>"<i>Qui va l&agrave;?</i>" demanded the sentry, as we came along at
a sharp trot.</p>

<p>"<i>L'&eacute;tat-major, Wagram!</i>" responded I, pressing on
without drawing rein;<br>
and in a moment we had regained our former position behind the
infantry. We<br>
had scarcely time to congratulate ourselves upon the success of
our scheme,<br>
when a tremendous clattering noise in front, mingled with the
galloping of<br>
horses and the cracking of whips, announced the approach of the
artillery<br>
as they came along by a narrow road which bisected our path; and
as they<br>
passed between us and the column, we could hear the muttered
sentences of<br>
the drivers, cursing the unseasonable time for an attack, and
swearing at<br>
their cattle in no measured tones.</p>

<p>"Did you hear that?" whispered Hampden; "the battery is about
to be<br>
directed against the San Benito, which must be far away to the
left.<br>
I heard one of the troop saying that they were to open their fire
at<br>
daybreak."</p>

<p>"All right, now," said I; "look there!"</p>

<p>From the hill we now stood upon a range of lanterns was
distinctly visible,<br>
stretching away for nearly half a mile.</p>

<p>"There are the trenches; they must be at work, too. See how
the lights are<br>
moving from place to place! Straight now. Forward!"</p>

<p>So saying, I pressed my horse boldly on.</p>

<p>We had not proceeded many minutes when the sounds of galloping
were heard<br>
coming along behind us.</p>

<p>"To the right, in the hollow," cried I. "Be still."</p>

<p>Scarcely had we moved off when several horsemen galloped up,
and drawing<br>
their reins to breathe their horses up the hill, we could hear
their voices<br>
as they conversed together.</p>

<p>In the few broken words we could catch, we guessed that the
attack upon San<br>
Benito was only a feint to induce Crawfurd to hold his position,
while<br>
the French, marching upon his flank and front, were to attack him
with<br>
overwhelming masses and crush him.</p>

<p>"You hear what's in store for us, O'Malley?" whispered
Hampden. "I think we<br>
could not possibly do better than hasten back with the
intelligence."</p>

<p>"We must not forget what we came for, first," said I; and the
next moment<br>
we were following the horsemen, who from their helmets seemed to
be<br>
horse-artillery officers.</p>

<p>The pace our guides rode at showed us that they knew their
ground. We<br>
passed several sentries, muttering something at each time, and
seeming as<br>
if only anxious to keep up with our party.</p>

<p>"They've halted," said I. "Now to the left there; gently here,
for we must<br>
be in the midst of their lines. Ha! I knew we were right. See
there!"</p>

<p>Before us, now, at a few hundred yards, we could perceive a
number of men<br>
engaged upon the field. Lights were moving from place to place
rapidly,<br>
while immediately in front a strong picket of cavalry were
halted.</p>

<p>"By Jove! there's sharp work of it to-night," whispered
Hampden. "They do<br>
intend to surprise us to-morrow."</p>

<p>"Gently now, to the left," said I, as cautiously skirting the
little hill,<br>
I kept my eye firmly fixed upon the watch-fire.</p>

<p>The storm, which for some time had abated considerably, was
now nearly<br>
quelled, and the moon again peeped forth amidst masses of black
and watery<br>
clouds.</p>

<p>"What good fortune for us!" thought I, at this moment, as I
surveyed the<br>
plain before me.</p>

<p>"I say, O'Malley, what are those fellows at yonder, where the
blue light is<br>
burning?"</p>

<p>"Ah! the very people we want; these are the sappers. Now for
it; that's our<br>
ground. We'll soon come upon their track now."</p>

<p>We pressed rapidly forward, passing an infantry party as we
went. The blue<br>
light was scarcely a hundred yards off; we could even hear the
shouting of<br>
the officers to their men in the trenches, when suddenly my horse
came down<br>
upon his head, and rolling over, crushed me to the earth.</p>

<p>"Not hurt, my boy," cried I, in a subdued tone, as Hampden
jumped down<br>
beside me.</p>

<p>It was the angle of a trench I had fallen into; and though
both my horse<br>
and myself felt stunned for the moment, we rallied the next
minute.</p>

<p>"Here is the very spot," said I. "Now, Mike, catch the bridles
and follow<br>
us closely."</p>

<p>Guiding ourselves along the edge of the trench, we crept
stealthily<br>
forward; the only watch-fire near was where the engineer party
was halted,<br>
and our object was to get outside of this.</p>

<p>"My turn this time," said Hampden, as he tripped suddenly, and
fell head<br>
foremost upon the grass.</p>

<p>As I assisted him to rise, something caught my ankle, and on
stooping I<br>
found it was a cord pegged fast into the ground, and lying only a
few<br>
inches above it.</p>

<p>"Now, steady! See here; this is their working line. Pass your
hand along it<br>
there, and let us follow it out."</p>

<p>While Hampden accordingly crept along on one side, I tracked
the cord upon<br>
the other. Here I found it terminating upon a small mound, where
probably<br>
some battery was to be erected. I accordingly gathered it
carefully up, and<br>
was returning towards my friend, when what was my horror to hear
Mike's<br>
voice, conversing, as it seemed to me, with some one in
French.</p>

<p>I stood fixed to the spot, my very heart beating almost in my
mouth as I<br>
listened.</p>

<p>"<i>Qui &ecirc;tes-vous done, mon ami?</i>" inquired a hoarse, deep
voice, a few yards<br>
off.</p>

<p>"<i>Bon cheval, non</i> beast, <i>sacr&eacute; nom de Dieu!</i>" A
hearty burst of laughter<br>
prevented my hearing the conclusion of Mike's French.</p>

<p>I now crept forward upon my hands and knees, till I could
catch the dark<br>
outline of the horses, one hand fixed upon my pistol trigger, and
my sword<br>
drawn in the other. Meanwhile the dialogue continued.</p>

<p>"<i>Vous &ecirc;tes d'Alsace, n'est-ce-pas?</i>" asked the
Frenchman, kindly supposing<br>
that Mike's French savored of Strasburg.</p>

<p>"Oh, blessed Virgin! av I might shoot him," was the muttered
reply.</p>

<p>Before I had time to see the effect of the last speech, I
pressed forward<br>
with a bold spring, and felled the Frenchman to the earth. My
hand had<br>
scarcely pressed upon his mouth, when Hampden was beside me.
Snatching up<br>
the pistol I let fall, he held it to the man's chest and
commanded him to<br>
be silent. To unfasten his girdle and bind the Frenchman's hands
behind<br>
him, was the work of a moment; and as the sharp click of the
pistol-cock<br>
seemed to calm his efforts to escape, we soon succeeded in
fastening a<br>
handkerchief tight across his mouth, and the next minute he was
placed<br>
behind Mike's saddle, firmly attached to this worthy individual
by his<br>
sword-belt.</p>

<p>"Now, a clear run home for it, and a fair start," said
Hampden, as he<br>
sprang into the saddle.</p>

<p>"Now, then, for it," I replied, as turning my horse's head
towards our<br>
lines, I dashed madly forward.</p>

<p>The moon was again obscured, but still the dark outline of the
hill which<br>
formed our encampment was discernible on the horizon. Riding side
by side,<br>
on we hurried,&mdash;now splashing through the deep wet marshes, now
plunging<br>
through small streams. Our horses were high in mettle, and we
spared them<br>
not. By taking a wide <i>d&eacute;tour</i> we had outflanked the
French pickets, and<br>
were almost out of all risk, when suddenly on coming to the verge
of rather<br>
a steep hill, we perceived beneath us a strong cavalry picket
standing<br>
around a watch-fire; their horses were ready saddled, the men
accoutred,<br>
and quite prepared for the field. While we conversed together in
whispers<br>
as to the course to follow, our deliberations were very rapidly
cut short.<br>
The French prisoner, who hitherto had given neither trouble nor
resistance,<br>
had managed to free his mouth from the encumbrance of the
handkerchief; and<br>
as we stood quietly discussing our plans, with one tremendous
effort he<br>
endeavored to hurl himself and Mike from the saddle, shouting out
as he did<br>
so,&mdash;</p>

<p>"<i>A moi camarades! &agrave; moi!</i>"</p>

<p>Hampden's pistol leaped from the holster as he spoke, and
levelling it with<br>
a deadly aim, he pulled the trigger; but I threw up his arm, and
the ball<br>
passed high above his head. To have killed the Frenchman would
have been to<br>
lose my faithful follower, who struggled manfully with his
adversary, and<br>
at length by throwing himself flatly forward upon the mane of his
horse,<br>
completely disabled him. Meanwhile the picket had sprung to their
saddles,<br>
and looked wildly about on every side.</p>

<p>Not a moment was to be lost; so turning our horses' heads
towards the<br>
plain, away we went. One loud cheer announced to us that we had
been seen,<br>
and the next instant the clash of the pursuing cavalry was heard
behind us.<br>
It was now entirely a question of speed, and little need we have
feared<br>
had Mike's horse not been doubly weighted. However, as we still
had<br>
considerably the start, and the gray dawn of day enabled us to
see the<br>
ground, the odds were in our favor. "Never let your horse's head
go," was<br>
my often repeated direction to Mike, as he spurred with all the
desperation<br>
of madness. Already the low meadow-land was in sight which
flanked the<br>
stream we had crossed in the morning, but unfortunately the heavy
rains had<br>
swollen it now to a considerable depth, and the muddy current,
choked with<br>
branches of trees and great stones, was hurrying down like a
torrent. "Take<br>
the river! never flinch it!" was my cry to my companions, as I
turned my<br>
head and saw a French dragoon, followed by two others, gaining
rapidly upon<br>
us. As I spoke, Mike dashed in, followed by Hampden, and the same
moment<br>
the sharp ring of a carbine whizzed past me. To take off the
pursuit from<br>
the others, I now wheeled my horse suddenly round, as if I feared
to take<br>
the stream, and dashed along by the river's bank.</p>

[A FLYING SHOT]
<br><br>

<p>Beneath me in the foaming current the two horsemen
labored,&mdash;now stemming<br>
the rush of water, now reeling almost beneath. A sharp cry burst
from Mike<br>
as I looked, and I saw the poor fellow bend nearly to his saddle.
I could<br>
see no more, for the chase was now hot upon myself. Behind me
rode a French<br>
dragoon, his carbine pressed tightly to his side, ready to fire
as he<br>
pressed on in pursuit. I had but one chance; so drawing my pistol
I wheeled<br>
suddenly in my saddle, and fired straight at him. The Frenchman
fell, while<br>
a regular volley from his party rung around me, one ball striking
my horse,<br>
and another lodging in the pommel of my saddle. The noble animal
reeled<br>
nearly to the earth, but as if rallying for a last effort, sprang
forward<br>
with renewed energy, and plunged boldly into the river. For a
moment,<br>
so sudden was my leap, my pursuers lost sight of me; but the bank
being<br>
somewhat steep, the efforts of my horse to climb again discovered
me, and<br>
before I reached the field two pistol-balls took effect upon
me,&mdash;one<br>
slightly grazed my side, but my bridle-arm was broken by the
other, and<br>
my hand fell motionless to my side. A cheer of defiance was,
however, my<br>
reply, as I turned round in my saddle, and the next moment I was
far beyond<br>
the range of their fire.</p>

<p>Not a man durst follow, and the last sight I had of them was
the dismounted<br>
group who stood around their dead comrade. Before me rode Hampden
and Mike,<br>
still at top speed, and never turning their heads backwards. I
hastened<br>
after them; but my poor, wounded horse, nearly hamstrung by the
shot,<br>
became dead lame, and it was past daybreak ere I reached the
first outposts<br>
of our lines.</p>

<br><br><br><br><p>CHAPTER IV.</p>

<p>THE DOCTOR.</p>

<p>"And his wound? Is it a serious one?" said a round, full
voice, as the<br>
doctor left my room at the conclusion of his visit.</p>

<p>"No, sir; a fractured bone is the worst of it,&mdash;the bullet
grazed, but did<br>
not cut the artery, and as&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, how soon will he be about again?"</p>

<p>"In a few weeks, if no fever sets in."</p>

<p>"There's no objection to my seeing him?&mdash;a few minutes
only,&mdash;I'll be<br>
cautious." So saying, and as it seemed to me, without waiting for
a reply,<br>
the door was opened by an aide-de-camp, who, announcing General
Crawfurd,<br>
closed it again, and withdrew.</p>

<p>The first glance I threw upon the general enabled me to
recognize the<br>
officer who, on the previous morning, had ridden up to the picket
and given<br>
us the orders to charge. I essayed to rise a little as he came
forward; but<br>
he motioned me with his hand to lie still, while, placing a chair
close<br>
beside my bed, he sat down.</p>

<p>"Very sorry for your mishap, sir, but glad it is no worse.
Moreton says<br>
that nothing of consequence is injured; there, you mustn't speak
except I<br>
ask you. Hampden has told me everything necessary; at least as
far as he<br>
knew. Is it your opinion, also, that any movement is in
contemplation; and<br>
from what circumstance?"</p>

<p>I immediately explained, and as briefly as I was able, the
reasons for<br>
suspecting such, with which he seemed quite satisfied. I detailed
the<br>
various changes in the positions of the troops that were taking
place<br>
during the night, the march of the artillery, and the strong
bodies of<br>
cavalry that were posted in reserve along the river.</p>

<p>"Very well, sir; they'll not move; your prisoner,
quartermaster of an<br>
infantry battalion, says not, also. Yours was a bold stroke, but
could not<br>
possibly have been of service, and the best thing I can do for
you is not<br>
to mention it,&mdash;a court-martial's but a poor recompense for a
gun-shot<br>
wound. Meanwhile, when this blows over, I'll appoint you on my
personal<br>
staff. There, not a word, I beg; and now, good-by."</p>

<p>So saying, and waving me an adieu with his hand, the gallant
veteran<br>
withdrew before I could express my gratitude for his
kindness.</p>

<p>I had little time for reflecting over my past adventure, such
numbers of my<br>
brother officers poured in upon me. All the doctor's cautions
respecting<br>
quietness and rest were disregarded, and a perfect levee sat the
entire<br>
morning in my bed-room. I was delighted to learn that Mike's
wound, though<br>
painful at the moment, was of no consequence; and indeed Hampden,
who<br>
escaped both steel and shot, was the worst off among us,&mdash;his
plunge in the<br>
river having brought on an ague he had labored under years
before.</p>

<p>"The illustrious Maurice has been twice here this morning, but
they<br>
wouldn't admit him. Your Scotch physician is afraid of his
Irish<br>
<i>confr&egrave;re</i>, and they had a rare set-to about Galen and
Hippocrates<br>
outside," said Baker.</p>

<p>"By-the-bye," said another, "did you see how Sparks looked
when Quill<br>
joined us? Egad, I never saw a fellow in such a fright; he
reddened up,<br>
then grew pale, turned his back, and slunk away at the very first
moment."</p>

<p>"Yes, I remember it. We must find out the reason; for Maurice,
depend upon<br>
it, has been hoaxing the poor fellow."</p>

<p>"Well, O'Malley," growled out the senior major, "you certainly
did give<br>
Hampden a benefit. He'll not trust himself in such company again;
and<br>
begad, he says, the man is as bad as the master. That fellow of
yours never<br>
let go his prisoner till he reached the quartermaster-general,
and they<br>
were both bathed in blood by that time."</p>

<p>"Poor Mike! we must do something for him."</p>

<p>"Oh, he's as happy as a king! Maurice has been in to see him,
and they've<br>
had a long chat about Ireland, and all the national pastimes of
whiskey<br>
drinking and smashing skulls. My very temples ache at the
recollection."</p>

<p>"Is Mister O'Mealey at home?" said a very rich Cork accent, as
the<br>
well-known and most droll features of Dr. Maurice Quill appeared
at the<br>
door.</p>

<p>"Come in, Maurice," said the major; "and for Heaven's sake,
behave<br>
properly. The poor fellow must not have a row about his
bedside."</p>

<p>"A row, a row! Upon my conscience, it is little you know about
a row, and<br>
there's worse things going than a row. Which leg is it?"</p>

<p>"It's an arm, Doctor, I'm happy to say."</p>

<p>"Not your punch hand, I hope. No; all's right. A neat fellow
you have for<br>
a servant, that Mickey Free. I was asking him about a townsman of
his<br>
own&mdash;one Tim Delany,&mdash;the very cut of himself, the best servant I
ever had.<br>
I never could make out what became of him. Old Hobson of the
95th, gave<br>
him to me, saying, 'There he is for you, Maurice, and a bigger
thief and a<br>
greater blackguard there's not in the 60th.'</p>

<p>"'Strong words,' said I.</p>

<p>"'And true' said he; 'he'd steal your molar tooth while you
were laughing<br>
at him.'</p>

<p>"'Let me have him, and try my hand on him, anyway. I've got no
one just<br>
now. Anything is better than nothing.'</p>

<p>"Well I took Tim, and sending for him to my room I locked the
door, and<br>
sitting down gravely before him explained in a few words that I
was quite<br>
aware of his little propensities.</p>

<p>"'Now,' said I, 'if you like to behave well, I'll think you as
honest as<br>
the chief-justice; but if I catch you stealing, if it be only the
value of<br>
a brass snuff-box, I'll have you flogged before the regiment as
sure as my<br>
name's Maurice.'</p>

<p>"Oh, I wish you heard the volley of protestations that fell
from him fast<br>
as hail. He was a calumniated man the world conspired to wrong
him; he was<br>
never a thief nor a rogue in his life. He had a weakness, he
confessed, for<br>
the ladies; but except that, he hoped he might die so thin that
he could<br>
shave himself with his shin-bone if he ever so much as took a
pinch of salt<br>
that wasn't his own.</p>

<p>"However this might be, nothing could be better than the way
Tim and I got<br>
on together. Everything was in its place, nothing missing; and in
fact, for<br>
upwards of a year, I went on wondering when he was to show out in
his true<br>
colors, for hitherto he had been a phoenix.</p>

<p>"At last,&mdash;we were quartered in Limerick at the time,&mdash;every
morning used<br>
to bring accounts of all manner of petty thefts in the
barrack,&mdash;one fellow<br>
had lost his belt, another his shoes, a third had
three-and-sixpence in<br>
his pocket when he went to bed and woke without a farthing, and
so on.<br>
Everybody save myself was mulet of something. At length some
rumors of<br>
Tim's former propensities got abroad; suspicion was excited; my
friend<br>
Delany was rigidly watched, and some very dubious circumstances
attached to<br>
the way he spent his evenings.</p>

<p>"My brother officers called upon me about the matter, and
although nothing<br>
had transpired like proof, I sent for Tim, and opened my mind on
the<br>
subject.</p>

<p>"You may talk of the look of conscious innocence, but I defy
you to<br>
conceive anything finer than the stare of offended honor Tim gave
me as I<br>
began.</p>

<p>"'They say it's me, Doctor,' said he, 'do they? And you,&mdash;you
believe them.<br>
You allow them to revile me that way? Well, well, the world is
come to a<br>
pretty pass, anyhow! Now, let me ask your honor a few questions?
How many<br>
shirts had yourself when I entered your service? Two, and one was
more like<br>
a fishing net! And how many have ye now? Eighteen; ay, eighteen
bran new<br>
cambrie ones,&mdash;devil a hole in one of them! How many pair of
stockings had<br>
you? Three and an odd one. You have two dozen this minute. How
many pocket<br>
handkerchiefs? One,&mdash;devil a more! You could only blow your nose
two days<br>
in the week, and now you may every hour of the twenty-four! And
as to<br>
the trilling articles of small value, snuff-boxes, gloves,
bootjacks,<br>
nightcaps, and&mdash;'</p>

<p>"'Stop, Tim, that's enough&mdash;'</p>

<p>"'No, sir, it is not,' said Tim, drawing himself up to his
full height;<br>
'you have wounded my feelings in a way I can't forget. It is
impossible<br>
we can have that mutual respect our position demands. Farewell,
farewell,<br>
Doctor, and forever!'</p>

<p>"Before I could say another word, the fellow had left the
room, and closed<br>
the door after him; and from that hour to this I never set eyes
on him."</p>

<p>In this vein did the worthy doctor run on till some more
discreet friend<br>
suggested that however well-intentioned the visit, I did not seem
to be<br>
fully equal to it,&mdash;my flushed cheek and anxious eye betraying
that the<br>
fever of my wound had commenced. They left me, therefore, once
more alone,<br>
and to my solitary musings over the vicissitudes of my
fortune.</p>

<br><br><br><br><p>CHAPTER V.</p>

<p>THE COA.</p>

<p>Within a week from the occurrence of the events just
mentioned, Ciudad<br>
Rodrigo surrendered, and Crawfurd assumed another position
beneath the<br>
walls of Almeida. The Spanish contingent having left us, we were
reinforced<br>
by the arrival of two battalions, renewed orders being sent not
to risk a<br>
battle, but if the French should advance, to retire beyond the
Coa.</p>

<p>On the evening of the 21st of July a strong body of French
cavalry advanced<br>
into the plain, supported by some heavy guns; upon which Crawfurd
retired<br>
upon the Coa, intending, as we supposed, to place that river
between<br>
himself and the enemy. Three days, however, passed over without
any<br>
movement upon either side, and we still continued, with a force
of scarcely<br>
four thousand infantry and a thousand dragoons, to stand opposite
to an<br>
army of nearly fifty thousand men. Such was our position as the
night of<br>
the 24th set in. I was sitting alone in my quarters. Mike, whose
wound had<br>
been severer than at first was supposed, had been sent to
Almeida, and I<br>
was musing in solitude upon the events of the campaign, when the
noise and<br>
bustle without excited my attention,&mdash;the roll of artillery
wagons, the<br>
clash of musketry, and the distant sounds of marching, all proved
that the<br>
troops were effecting some new movement, and I burned with
anxiety to<br>
learn what it was. My brother officers, however, came not as
usual to my<br>
quarters; and although I waited with impatience while the hours
rolled by,<br>
no one appeared.</p>

<p>Long, low moaning gusts of wind swept along the earth,
carrying the leaves<br>
as they tore them from the trees, and mingling their sad sounds
with the<br>
noises of the retiring troops; for I could perceive that
gradually the<br>
sounds grew more and more remote, and only now and then could I
trace their<br>
position as the roll of a distant drum swelled upon the breeze,
or the<br>
more shrill cry of a pibroch broke upon my ear. A heavy downpour
of rain<br>
followed soon after, and in its unceasing plash drowned all other
sounds.</p>

<p>As the little building shook beneath the peals of loud
thunder, the<br>
lightning flashed in broad sheets upon the rapid river, which,
swollen and<br>
foaming, dashed impetuously beside my window. By the uncertain
but vivid<br>
glare of the flashes, I endeavored to ascertain where our force
was posted,<br>
but in vain. Never did I witness such a night of storm,&mdash;the deep
booming<br>
of the thunder seeming never for a moment to cease, while the
rush of the<br>
torrent grew gradually louder, till at length it swelled into one
deep and<br>
sullen roar like that of distant artillery.</p>

<p>Weak and nervous as I felt from the effects of my wound,
feverish and<br>
exhausted by days of suffering and sleepless nights, I paced my
little room<br>
with tottering but impatient steps. The sense of my sad and
imprisoned<br>
state impressed me deeply; and while from time to time I
replenished my<br>
fire, and hoped to hear some friendly step upon the stair, my
heart grew<br>
gradually heavier, and every gloomy and depressing thought
suggested itself<br>
to my imagination. My most constant impression was that the
troops were<br>
retiring beyond the Coa, and that, forgotten in the haste and
confusion of<br>
a night march, I had been left behind to fall a prisoner to the
enemy.</p>

<p>The sounds of the troops retiring gradually farther and
farther favored the<br>
idea, in which I was still more strengthened on finding that the
peasants<br>
who inhabited the little hut had departed, leaving me utterly
alone. From<br>
the moment I ascertained this fact, my impatience knew no bounds;
and in<br>
proportion as I began to feel some exertion necessary on my part,
so much<br>
more did my nervousness increase my debility, and at last I sank
exhausted<br>
upon my bed, while a cold perspiration broke out upon my
temples.</p>

<p>I have mentioned that the Coa was immediately beneath the
house; I must<br>
also add that the little building occupied the angle of a steep
but narrow<br>
gorge which descended from the plain to the bridge across the
stream. This,<br>
as far as I knew, was the only means we possessed of passing the
river; so<br>
that, when the last retiring sounds of the troops were heard by
me, I began<br>
to suspect that Crawfurd, in compliance with his orders, was
making a<br>
backward movement, leaving the bridge open to the French, to draw
them<br>
on to his line of march, while he should cross over at some more
distant<br>
point.</p>

<p>As the night grew later, the storm seemed to increase; the
waves of the<br>
foaming river dashed against the frail walls of the hut, while
its roof,<br>
rent by the blast, fell in fragments upon the stream, and all
threatened a<br>
speedy and perfect ruin.</p>

<p>How I longed for morning! The doubt and uncertainty I suffered
nearly drove<br>
me distracted. Of all the casualties my career as a soldier
opened, none<br>
had such terrors for me as imprisonment; the very thought of the
long years<br>
of inaction and inglorious idleness was worse than any death. My
wounds,<br>
and the state of fever I was in, increased the morbid dread upon
me, and<br>
had the French captured me at the time, I know not that madness
of which<br>
I was not capable. Day broke at last, but slowly and sullenly;
the gray<br>
clouds hurried past upon the storm, pouring down the rain in
torrents as<br>
they went, and the desolation and dreariness on all sides was
scarcely<br>
preferable to the darkness and gloom of night. My eyes were
turned ever<br>
towards the plain, across which the winter wind bore the plashing
rain in<br>
vast sheets of water; the thunder crashed louder and louder; but
except the<br>
sounds of the storm none others met my ear. Not a man, not a
human figure<br>
could I see, as I strained my sight towards the distant
horizon.</p>

<p>The morning crept over, but the storm abated not, and the same
unchanged<br>
aspect of dreary desolation prevailed without. At times I thought
I could<br>
hear, amidst the noises of the tempest, something like the roll
of distant<br>
artillery; but the thunder swelled in sullen roar above all, and
left me<br>
uncertain as before.</p>

<p>At last, in a momentary pause of the storm, a tremendous peal
of heavy<br>
guns caught my ear, followed by the long rattling of small-arms.
My heart<br>
bounded with ecstasy. The thoughts of the battle-field, with all
its<br>
changing fortunes, was better, a thousand times better, than the
despairing<br>
sense of desertion I labored under. I listened now with
eagerness, but<br>
the rain bore down again in torrents, and the crumbling walls and
falling<br>
timbers left no other sounds to be heard. Far as my eye could
reach,<br>
nothing could still be seen save the dreary monotony of the vast
plain,<br>
undulating slightly here and there, but unmarked by a sign of
man.</p>

<p>Far away towards the horizon I had remarked for some time past
that the<br>
clouds resting upon the earth grew blacker and blacker, spreading
out to<br>
either side in vast masses, and not broken or wafted along like
the rest.<br>
As I watched the phenomenon with an anxious eye, I perceived the
dense mass<br>
suddenly appear, as it were, rent asunder, while a volume of
liquid flame<br>
rushed wildly out, throwing a lurid glare on every side. One
terrific clap,<br>
louder than any thunder, shook the air at this moment, while the
very earth<br>
trembled beneath the shock.</p>

<p>As I hesitated what it might be, the heavy din of great guns
again was<br>
heard, and from the midst of the black smoke rode forth a dark
mass,<br>
which I soon recognized as the horse-artillery at full gallop.
They were<br>
directing their course towards the bridge.</p>

<p>As they mounted the little rising ground, they wheeled and
unlimbered with<br>
the speed of lightning, just as a strong column of cavalry showed
above the<br>
ridge. One tremendous discharge again shook the field, and ere
the smoke<br>
cleared away they were again far in retreat.</p>

<p>So much was my attention occupied with this movement that I
had not<br>
perceived the long line of infantry that came from the extreme
left, and<br>
were now advancing also towards the bridge at a brisk quick-step;
scattered<br>
bodies of cavalry came up from different parts, while from the
little<br>
valley, every now and then, a rifleman would mount the rising
ground,<br>
turning to fire as he retreated. All this boded a rapid and
disorderly<br>
retreat; and although as yet I could see nothing of the pursuing
enemy, I<br>
knew too well the relative forces of each to have a doubt for the
result.</p>

<p>At last the head of a French column appeared above the mist,
and I could<br>
plainly distinguish the gestures of the officers as they hurried
their men<br>
onwards. Meanwhile a loud hurra attracted my attention, and I
turned my eye<br>
towards the road which led to the river. Here a small body of the
95th had<br>
hurriedly assembled, and formed again, were standing to cover the
retreat<br>
of the broken infantry as they passed on eagerly to the bridge;
in a second<br>
after the French cuirassiers appeared. Little anticipating
resistance from<br>
a flying and disordered mass, they rode headlong forward, and
although the<br>
firm attitude and steady bearing of the Highlanders might have
appalled<br>
them, they rode heedlessly down upon the square, sabring the very
men in<br>
the front rank. Till now not a trigger had been pulled, when
suddenly the<br>
word "Fire!" was given, and a withering volley of balls sent the
cavalry<br>
column in shivers. One hearty cheer broke from the infantry in
the rear,<br>
and I could hear "Gallant Ninety-fifth!" shouted on every side
along the<br>
plain.</p>

<p>The whole vast space before me was now one animated
battle-ground. Our own<br>
troops, retiring in haste before the overwhelming forces of the
French,<br>
occupied every little vantage ground with their guns and light
infantry,<br>
charges of cavalry coursing hither and thither; while, as the
French<br>
pressed forward, the retreating columns again formed into squares
to<br>
permit stragglers to come up. The rattle of small-arms, the heavy
peal of<br>
artillery, the earth-quake crash of cavalry, rose on every side,
while the<br>
cheers which alternately told of the vacillating fortune of the
fight rose<br>
amidst the wild pibroch of the Highlanders.</p>

<p>A tremendous noise now took place on the floor beneath me; and
looking<br>
down, I perceived that a sergeant and party of sappers had taken
possession<br>
of the little hut, and were busily engaged in piercing the walls
for<br>
musketry; and before many minutes had elapsed, a company of the
Rifles were<br>
thrown into the building, which, from its commanding position
above the<br>
road, enfiladed the whole line of march. The officer in command
briefly<br>
informed me that we had been attacked that morning by the French
in force,<br>
and "devilishly well thrashed;" that we were now in retreat
beyond the Coa,<br>
where we ought to have been three days previously, and desired me
to cross<br>
the bridge and get myself out of the way as soon as I possibly
could.</p>

<p>A twenty-four pounder from the French lines struck the angle
of the house<br>
as he spoke, scattering the mortar and broken bricks about us on
all sides.<br>
This was warning sufficient for me, wounded and disabled as I
was; so<br>
taking the few things I could save in my haste, I hurried from
the hut, and<br>
descending the path, now slippery by the heavy rain, I took my
way across<br>
the bridge, and established myself on a little rising knoll of
ground<br>
beyond, from which a clear view could be obtained of the whole
field.</p>

<p>I had not been many minutes in my present position ere the
pass which led<br>
down to the bridge became thronged with troops, wagons,
ammunition carts,<br>
and hospital stores, pressing thickly forward amidst shouting and
uproar;<br>
the hills on either side of the way were crowded with troops, who
formed<br>
as they came up, the artillery taking up their position on every
rising<br>
ground. The firing had already begun, and the heavy booming of
the large<br>
guns was heard at intervals amidst the rattling crash of
musketry. Except<br>
the narrow road before me, and the high bank of the stream, I
could see<br>
nothing; but the tumult and din, which grew momentarily louder,
told that<br>
the tide of battle raged nearer and nearer. Still the retreat
continued;<br>
and at length the heavy artillery came thundering across the
narrow bridge<br>
followed by stragglers of all arms, and wounded, hurrying to the
rear. The<br>
sharpshooters and the Highlanders held the heights above the
stream, thus<br>
covering the retiring columns; but I could plainly perceive that
their fire<br>
was gradually slackening, and that the guns which flanked their
position<br>
were withdrawn, and everything bespoke a speedy retreat. A
tremendous<br>
discharge of musketry at this moment, accompanied by a deafening
cheer,<br>
announced the advance of the French, and soon the head of the
Highland<br>
brigade was seen descending towards the bridge, followed by the
Rifles and<br>
the 95th; the cavalry, consisting of the 11th and 14th Light
Dragoons, were<br>
now formed in column of attack, and the infantry deployed into
line; and in<br>
an instant after, high above the din and crash of battle, I heard
the word<br>
"Charge!" The rising crest of the hill hid them from my sight,
but my heart<br>
bounded with ecstasy as I listened to the clanging sound of the
cavalry<br>
advance. Meanwhile the infantry pressed on, and forming upon the
bank,<br>
took up a strong position in front of the bridge; the heavy guns
were<br>
also unlimbered, riflemen scattered through the low copse-wood,
and every<br>
precaution taken to defend the pass to the last. For a moment all
my<br>
attention was riveted to the movements upon our own side of the
stream,<br>
when suddenly the cavalry bugle sounded the recall, and the same
moment<br>
the staff came galloping across the bridge. One officer I could
perceive,<br>
covered with orders and trappings, his head was bare, and his
horse,<br>
splashed with blood and foam, moved lamely and with difficulty;
he turned<br>
in the middle of the bridge, as if irresolute whether to retreat
farther.<br>
One glance at him showed me the bronzed, manly features of our
leader.<br>
Whatever his resolve, the matter was soon decided for him, for
the cavalry<br>
came galloping swiftly down the slope, and in an instant the
bridge was<br>
blocked up by the retreating forces, while the French as suddenly
appearing<br>
above the height, opened a plunging fire upon their defenceless
enemies;<br>
their cheer of triumph was answered by our fellows from the
opposite bank,<br>
and a heavy cannonade thundered along the rocky valley, sending
up a<br>
hundred echoes as it went.</p>

<p>The scene now became one of overwhelming interest; the French,
posting<br>
their guns upon the height, replied to our fire, while their
line, breaking<br>
into skirmishers, descended the banks to the river's edge, and
poured<br>
in one sheet of galling musketry. The road to the bridge, swept
by our<br>
artillery, presented not a single file; and although a movement
among<br>
the French announced the threat of an attack, the deadly service
of the<br>
artillery seemed to pronounce it hopeless.</p>

<p>A strong cavalry force stood inactively spectators of the
combat, on the<br>
French side, among whom I now remarked some bustle and
preparation, and as<br>
I looked an officer rode boldly to the river's edge, and spurring
his horse<br>
forward, plunged into the stream. The swollen and angry torrent,
increased<br>
by the late rains, boiled like barm, and foamed around him as he
advanced;<br>
when suddenly his horse appeared to have lost its footing, and
the rapid<br>
current, circling around him, bore him along with it. He labored
madly, but<br>
in vain, to retrace his steps; the rolling torrent rose above his
saddle,<br>
and all that his gallant steed could do was barely sufficient to
keep<br>
afloat; both man and horse were carried down between the
contending<br>
armies. I could see him wave his hand to his comrades, as if in
adieu. One<br>
deafening cheer of admiration rose from the French lines, and the
next<br>
moment he was seen to fall from his seat, and his body, shattered
with<br>
balls, floated mournfully upon the stream.</p>

<p>This little incident, to which both armies were witnesses,
seemed to have<br>
called forth all the fiercer passions of the contending forces; a
loud yell<br>
of taunting triumph rose from the Highlanders, responded to by a
cry of<br>
vengeance from the French, and the same moment the head of a
column was<br>
seen descending the narrow causeway to the bridge, while an
officer with a<br>
whole blaze of decorations and crosses sprang from his horse and
took the<br>
lead. The little drummer, a child of scarcely ten years old,
tripped gayly<br>
on, beating his little <i>pas des charge</i>, seeming rather like the
play of<br>
infancy than the summons to death and carnage, as the heavy guns
of the<br>
French opened a volume of fire and flame to cover the attacking
column. For<br>
a moment all was hid from our eyes; the moment after the
grape-shot swept<br>
along the narrow causeway; and the bridge, which but a second
before was<br>
crowded with the life and courage of a noble column, was now one
heap of<br>
dead and dying. The gallant fellow who led them on fell among the
first<br>
rank, and the little child, as if kneeling, was struck dead
beside the<br>
parapet; his fair hair floated across his cold features, and
seemed in its<br>
motion to lend a look of life where the heart's throb had ceased
forever.<br>
The artillery again re-opened upon us; and when the smoke had
cleared away,<br>
we discovered that the French had advanced to the middle of the
bridge and<br>
carried off the body of their general. Twice they essayed to
cross, and<br>
twice the death-dealing fire of our guns covered the narrow
bridge with<br>
slain, while by the wild pibroch of the 42d, swelling madly into
notes of<br>
exultation and triumph, the Highlanders could scarcely be
prevented from<br>
advancing hand to hand with the foe. Gradually the French
slackened their<br>
fire, their great guns were one by one withdrawn from the
heights, and a<br>
dropping, irregular musketry at intervals sustained the fight,
which, ere<br>
sunset, ceased altogether; and thus ended "The Battle of the
Coa!"</p>

<br><br><br><br><p>CHAPTER VI.</p>

<p>THE NIGHT MARCH.</p>

<p>Scarcely had the night fallen when our retreat commenced.
Tired and weary<br>
as our brave fellows felt, but little repose was allowed them;
their<br>
bivouac fires were blazing brightly, and they had just thrown
themselves<br>
in groups around them, when the word to fall in was passed from
troop to<br>
troop, and from battalion to battalion,&mdash;no trumpet, no bugle
called them<br>
to their ranks. It was necessary that all should be done
noiselessly and<br>
speedily; while, therefore, the wounded were marched to the
front, and<br>
the heavy artillery with them, a brigade of light four pounders
and two<br>
squadrons of cavalry held the heights above the bridge, and the
infantry,<br>
forming into three columns, began their march.</p>

<p>My wound, forgotten in the heat and excitement of the
conflict, was now<br>
becoming excessively painful, and I gladly availed myself of a
place in a<br>
wagon, where, stretched upon some fresh straw, with no other
covering save<br>
the starry sky, I soon fell sound asleep, and neither the heavy
jolting of<br>
the rough conveyance, nor the deep and rutty road, were able to
disturb my<br>
slumbers. Still through my sleep I heard the sounds around me,
the heavy<br>
tramp of infantry, the clash of the moving squadrons, and the
dull roll of<br>
artillery; and ever and anon the half-stifled cry of pain,
mingling with<br>
the reckless carol of some drinking-song, all flitted through my
dreams,<br>
lending to my thoughts of home and friends a memory of glorious
war.</p>

<p>All the vicissitudes of a soldier's life passed then in review
before me,<br>
elicited in some measure by the things about. The pomp and
grandeur, the<br>
misery and meanness, the triumph, the defeat, the moment of
victory, and<br>
the hour of death were there, and in that vivid dream I lived a
life long.</p>

<p>I awoke at length, the cold and chilling air which follows
midnight blew<br>
around me, and my wounded arm felt as though it were frozen. I
tried to<br>
cover myself beneath the straw, but in vain; and as my limbs
trembled and<br>
my teeth chattered, I thought again of home, where, at that
moment, the<br>
poorest menial of my uncle's house was better lodged than I; and
strange to<br>
say, something of pride mingled with the thought, and in my
lonely heart a<br>
feeling of elation cheered me.</p>

<p>These reflections were interrupted by the sound of a voice
near me, which I<br>
at once knew to be O'Shaughnessy's; he was on foot, and speaking
evidently<br>
in some excitement.</p>

<p>"I tell you, Maurice, some confounded blunder there must be;
sure, he was<br>
left in the cottage near the bridge, and no one ever saw him
after."</p>

<p>"The French took it from the Rifles before we crossed the
river. By Jove!<br>
I'll wager my chance of promotion against a pint of sherry, he'll
turn up<br>
somewhere in the morning; those Galway chaps have as many lives
as a cat."</p>

<p>"See, now, Maurice, I wouldn't for a full colonelcy anything
would happen<br>
to him; I like the boy."</p>

<p>"So do I myself; but I tell you there's no danger of him. Did
you ask<br>
Sparks anything?"</p>

<p>"Ask Sparks! God help you! Sparks would go off in a fit at the
sight of me.<br>
No, no, poor creature! it's little use it would be my speaking to
him."</p>

<p>"Why so, Doctor!" cried I, from my straw couch.</p>

<p>"May I never, if it's not him! Charley, my son, I'm glad
you're safe.<br>
'Faith, I thought you were on your way to Verdun by this
time."</p>

<p>"Sure, I told you he'd find his way here&mdash;But, O'Mealey, dear,
you're<br>
mighty could,&mdash;a rigor, as old M'Lauchlan would call it."</p>

<p>"E'en sae, Maister Quill," said a broad Scotch accent behind
him; "and I<br>
canna see ony objection to giein' things their right names."</p>

<p>"The top of the morning to you," said Quill, familiarly
patting him on the<br>
back; "how goes it, old Brimstone?"</p>

<p>The conversation might not have taken a very amicable turn had
M'Lauchlan<br>
heard the latter part of this speech; but, as happily he was
engaged<br>
unpacking a small canteen which he had placed in the wagon, it
passed<br>
unnoticed.</p>

<p>"You'll nae dislike a toothfu' of something warm, Major," said
he,<br>
presenting a glass to O'Shaughnessy; "and if ye'll permit me, Mr.
O'Mealey,<br>
to help you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"A thousand thanks, Doctor; but I fear a broken arm&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There's naething in the whiskey to prevent the proper
formation of<br>
callus."</p>

<p>"By the rock of Cashel, it never made any one callous," said
O'Shaughnessy,<br>
mistaking the import of the phrase.</p>

<p>"Ye are nae drinking frae the flask?" said the doctor, turning
in some<br>
agitation towards Quill.</p>

<p>"Devil a bit, my darling. I've a little horn convaniency here,
that holds<br>
half-a-pint, nice measure."</p>

<p>I don't imagine that our worthy friend participated in Quill's
admiration<br>
of the "convaniency," for he added, in a dry tone:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Ye may as weel tak your liquor frae a glass, like a
Christian, as stick<br>
your nose in a coo's horn."</p>

<p>"By my conscience, you're no small judge of spirits, wherever
you learned<br>
it," said the major; "it's like Islay malt!"</p>

<p>"I was aye reckoned a gude ane," said the doctor, "and my
mither's brither<br>
Caimbogie had na his like in the north country. Ye may be heerd
tell what<br>
he aince said to the Duchess of Argyle, when she sent for him to
taste her<br>
claret."</p>

<p>"Never heard of it," quoth Quill; "let's have it by all means.
I'd like to<br>
hear what the duchess said to him."</p>

<p>"It was na what the duchess said to him, but what he said to
the duchess,<br>
ye ken. The way of it was this: My uncle Caimbogie was aye up at
the<br>
castle, for besides his knowledge of liquor, there was nae his
match for<br>
deer-stalking, or spearing a salmon, in those parts. He was a
great, rough<br>
carle, it's true; but ane ye'd rather crack wi' than fight
wi'.</p>

<p>"Weel, ae day they had a grand dinner at the duke's, and there
were plenty<br>
o' great southern lords and braw leddies in velvets and satin;
and vara<br>
muckle surprised they were at my uncle, when he came in wi' his
tartan<br>
kilt, in full Highland dress, as the head of a clan ought to do.
Caimbogie,<br>
however, pe'd nae attention to them; but he eat his dinner, and
drank his<br>
wine, and talked away about fallow and red deer, and at last the
duchess,<br>
for she was aye fond o' him, addressed him frae the head o' the
table:&mdash;</p>

<p>"'Cambogie,' quoth she, 'I'd like to hae your opinion about
that wine. It's<br>
some the duke has just received, and we should like to hear what
you think<br>
of it.'</p>

<p>"'It's nae sae bad, my leddy,' said my uncle; for ye see he
was a man of<br>
few words, and never flattered onybody.</p>

<p>"'Then you don't approve much of it?' said the duchess.</p>

<p>"'I've drank better, and I've drank waur,' quo' he.</p>

<p>"'I'm sorry you don't like it, Caimbogie,' said the duchess,
'for it can<br>
never be popular now,&mdash;we have such a dependence upon your
taste.'</p>

<p>"'I cauna say ower muckle for my <i>taste</i>, my leddy, but ae
thing I <i>will</i><br>
say,&mdash;I've a most damnable <i>smell!</i>'</p>

<p>"I hear that never since the auld walls stood was there ever
the like o'<br>
the laughing that followed; the puir duke himsel' was carried
away, and<br>
nearly had a fit, and a' the grand lords and leddies a'most died
of it. But<br>
see here, the earle has nae left a drap o' whiskey in the
flask."</p>

<p>"The last glass I drained to your respectable uncle's health,"
said Quill,<br>
with a most professional gravity. "Now, Charlie, make a little
room for me<br>
in the straw."</p>

<p>The doctor soon mounted beside me, and giving me a share of
his ample<br>
cloak, considerably ameliorated my situation.</p>

<p>"So you knew Sparks, Doctor?" said I, with a strong curiosity
to hear<br>
something of his early acquaintance.</p>

<p>"That I did: I knew him when he was an ensign in the 10th
Foot; and, to say<br>
the truth, he is not much changed since that time,&mdash;the same
lively look of<br>
a sick cod-fish about his gray eyes; the same disorderly wave of
his yellow<br>
hair; the same whining voice, and that confounded apothecary's
laugh."</p>

<p>"Come, come, Doctor, Sparks is a good fellow at heart; I won't
have him<br>
abused. I never knew he had been in the infantry; I should think
it must<br>
have been another of the same name."</p>

<p>"Not at all; there's only one like him in the service, and
that's himself.<br>
Confound it, man, I'd know his skin upon a bush; he was only
three weeks<br>
in the Tenth, and, indeed, your humble servant has the whole
merit of his<br>
leaving it so soon."</p>

<p>"Do let us hear how that happened."</p>

<p>"Simply thus: The jolly Tenth were some four years ago the
pleasantest<br>
corps in the army; from the lieutenant-colonel down to the last
joined<br>
sub., all were out-and-outers,&mdash;real gay fellows. The mess was,
in fact,<br>
like a pleasant club, and if you did not suit it, the best thing
you could<br>
do was to sell out or exchange into a slower regiment; and,
indeed, this<br>
very wholesome truth was not very long in reaching your ears some
way or<br>
other, and a man that could remain after being given this hint,
was likely<br>
to go afterwards without one."</p>

<p>Just as Dr. Quill reached this part of his story, an orderly
dragoon<br>
galloped furiously past, and the next moment an aide-de-camp rode
by,<br>
calling as he passed us,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Close up, there! Close up! Get forward, my lads! get
forward!"</p>

<p>It was evident, from the stir and bustle about, that some
movement was<br>
being made; and soon after, a dropping, irregular fire from the
rear showed<br>
that our cavalry were engaged with the enemy. The affair was
scarcely of<br>
five minutes' duration, and our march resumed all its former
regularity<br>
immediately after.</p>

<p>I now turned to the doctor to resume his story, but he was
gone; at what<br>
moment he left I could not say, but O'Shaughnessy was also
absent, nor did<br>
I again meet with them for a considerable time after.</p>

<p>Towards daybreak we halted at Bonares, when, my wound
demanding rest and<br>
attention, I was billeted in the village, and consigned to all
the miseries<br>
of a sick bed.</p>

<br><br><br><br><p>CHAPTER VII.</p>

<p>THE JOURNEY.</p>

<p>With that disastrous day my campaigning was destined, for some
time<br>
at least, to conclude. My wound, which grew from hour to hour
more<br>
threatening, at length began to menace the loss of the arm, and
by the<br>
recommendation of the regimental surgeons, I was ordered back to
Lisbon.</p>

<p>Mike, by this time perfectly restored, prepared everything for
my<br>
departure, and on the third day after the battle of the Coa, I
began my<br>
journey with downcast spirits and depressed heart. The poor
fellow was,<br>
however, a kind and affectionate nurse, and unlike many others,
his cares<br>
were not limited to the mere bodily wants of his patient,&mdash;he
sustained,<br>
as well as he was able, my drooping resolution, rallied my
spirits, and<br>
cheered my courage. With the very little Portuguese he possessed,
he<br>
contrived to make every imaginable species of bargain; always
managed a<br>
good billet; kept every one in good humor, and rarely left his
quarters in<br>
the morning without a most affective leave-taking, and reiterated
promises<br>
to renew his visit.</p>

<p>Our journeys were usually short ones, and already two days had
elapsed,<br>
when, towards nightfall, we entered the little hamlet of Jaffra.
During the<br>
entire of that day, the pain of my wounded limb had been
excruciating; the<br>
fatigue of the road and the heat had brought back violent
inflammation, and<br>
when at last the little village came in sight, my reason was fast
yielding<br>
to the torturing agonies of my wound. But the transports with
which I<br>
greeted my resting-place were soon destined to a change; for as
we drew<br>
near, not a light was to be seen, not a sound to be heard, not
even a dog<br>
barked as the heavy mule-cart rattled over the uneven road. No
trace of<br>
any living thing was there. The little hamlet lay sleeping in the
pale<br>
moonlight, its streets deserted, and its homes tenantless; our
own<br>
footsteps alone echoed along the dreary causeway. Here and there,
as we<br>
advanced farther, we found some relics of broken furniture and
house-gear;<br>
most of the doors lay open, but nothing remained within save bare
walls;<br>
the embers still smoked in many places upon the hearth, and
showed us that<br>
the flight of the inhabitants had been recent. Yet everything
convinced<br>
us that the French had not been there; there was no trace of the
reckless<br>
violence and wanton cruelty which marked their footsteps
everywhere.</p>

<p>All proved that the desertion had been voluntary; perhaps in
compliance<br>
with an order of our commander-in-chief, who frequently desired
any<br>
intended line of march of the enemy to be left thus a desert. As
we<br>
sauntered slowly on from street to street, half hoping that some
one human<br>
being yet remained behind, and casting our eyes from side to side
in search<br>
of quarters for the night, Mike suddenly came running up,
saying,&mdash;</p>

<p>"I have it, sir; I've found it out. There's people living down
that small<br>
street there; I saw a light this minute as I passed."</p>

<p>I turned immediately, and accompanied by the mule-driver,
followed Mike<br>
across a little open square into a small and narrow street, at
the end<br>
of which a light was seen faintly twinkling. We hurried on and in
a few<br>
minutes reached a high wall of solid masonry, from a niche of
which we now<br>
discovered, to our utter disappointment, the light proceeded. It
was a<br>
small lamp placed before a little waxen image of the Virgin, and
was<br>
probably the last act of piety of some poor villager ere he left
his home<br>
and hearth forever. There it burned, brightly and tranquilly,
throwing its<br>
mellow ray upon the cold, deserted stones.</p>

<p>Whatever impatience I might have given way to in a moment of
chagrin was<br>
soon repressed, as I saw my two followers, uncovering their heads
in silent<br>
reverence, kneel down before the little shrine. There was
something at once<br>
touching and solemn in this simultaneous feeling of homage from
the hearts<br>
of those removed in country, language, and in blood. They bent
meekly down,<br>
their heads bowed upon their bosoms, while with muttering voices
each<br>
offered up his prayer. All sense of their disappointment, all
memory of<br>
their forlorn state, seemed to have yielded to more powerful and
absorbing<br>
thoughts, as they opened their hearts in prayer.</p>

<p>My eyes were still fixed upon them when suddenly Mike, whose
devotion<br>
seemed of the briefest, sprang to his legs, and with a spirit of
levity<br>
but little in accordance with his late proceedings, commenced a
series of<br>
kicking, rapping, and knocking at a small oak postern sufficient
to have<br>
aroused a whole convent from their cells. "House there! Good
people<br>
within!"&mdash;bang, bang, bang; but the echoes alone responded to his
call,<br>
and the sounds died away at length in the distant streets,
leaving all as<br>
silent and dreary as before.</p>

<p>Our Portuguese friend, who by this time had finished his
orisons, now began<br>
a vigorous attack upon the small door, and with the assistance of
Mike,<br>
armed with a fragment of granite about the size of a man's head,
at length<br>
separated the frame from the hinges, and sent the whole mass
prostrate<br>
before us.</p>

<p>The moon was just rising as we entered the little park, where
gravelled<br>
walks, neatly kept and well-trimmed, bespoke recent care and
attention;<br>
following a handsome alley of lime-trees, we reached a little
<i>jet d'eau</i>,<br>
whose sparkling fountain shone diamond-like in the moonbeams, and
escaping<br>
from the edge of a vast shell, ran murmuring amidst mossy stones
and<br>
water-lilies that, however naturally they seemed thrown around,
bespoke<br>
also the hand of taste in their position. On turning from the
spot, we came<br>
directly in front of an old but handsome ch&acirc;teau, before
which stretched<br>
a terrace of considerable extent. Its balustraded parapet lined
with<br>
orange-trees, now in full blossom, scented the still air with
delicious<br>
odor; marble statues peeped here and there amidst the foliage,
while a rich<br>
acacia, loaded with flowers, covered the walls of the building,
and hung in<br>
vast masses of variegated blossom across the tall windows.</p>

<p>As leaning on Mike's arm I slowly ascended the steps of the
terrace, I was<br>
more than ever struck with the silence and death-like stillness
around;<br>
except the gentle plash of the fountain, all was at rest; the
very plants<br>
seemed to sleep in the yellow moonlight, and not a trace of any
living<br>
thing was there.</p>

<p>The massive door lay open as we entered the spacious hall
flagged with<br>
marble and surrounded with armorial bearings. We advanced farther
and came<br>
to a broad and handsome stair, which led us to a long gallery,
from which<br>
a suit of rooms opened, looking towards the front part of the
building.<br>
Wherever we went, the furniture appeared perfectly untouched;
nothing was<br>
removed; the very chairs were grouped around the windows and the
tables;<br>
books, as if suddenly dropped from their readers' hands, were
scattered<br>
upon the sofas and the ottomans; and in one small apartment,
whose blue<br>
satin walls and damask drapery bespoke a boudoir, a rich mantilla
of<br>
black velvet and a silk glove were thrown upon a chair. It was
clear the<br>
desertion had been most recent, and everything indicated that no
time had<br>
been given to the fugitives to prepare for flight. What a sad
picture of<br>
war was there! To think of those whose home was endeared to them
by all<br>
the refinements of cultivated life and all the associations of
years of<br>
happiness sent out upon the wide world wanderers and houseless,
while<br>
their hearth, sacred by every tie that binds us to our kindred,
was to<br>
be desecrated by the ruthless and savage hands of a ruffian
soldiery. I<br>
thought of them,&mdash;perhaps at that very hour their thoughts were
clinging<br>
round the old walls, remembering each well-beloved spot, while
they took<br>
their lonely path through mountain and through valley,&mdash;and felt
ashamed<br>
and abashed at my own intrusion there. While thus my revery ran
on, I<br>
had not perceived that Mike, whose views were very practical upon
all<br>
occasions, had lighted a most cheerful fire upon the hearth, and
disposing<br>
a large sofa before it, had carefully closed the curtains; and
was, in<br>
fact, making himself and his master as much at home as though he
had spent<br>
his life there.</p>

<p>"Isn't it a beautiful place, Misther Charles? And this little
room, doesn't<br>
it remind you of the blue bed-room in O'Malley Castle, barrin'
the elegant<br>
view out upon the Shannon, and the mountain of Scariff?"</p>

<p>Nothing short of Mike's patriotism could forgive such a
comparison; but,<br>
however, I did not contradict him as he ran on:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Faith, I knew well there was luck in store for us this
evening; and ye see<br>
the handful of prayers I threw away outside wasn't lost.
Jos&eacute;'s making<br>
the beasts comfortable in the stable, and I'm thinking we'll none
of us<br>
complain of our quarters. But you're not eating your supper; and
the<br>
beautiful hare-pie that I stole this morning, won't you taste it?
Well, a<br>
glass of Malaga? Not a glass of Malaga? Oh, mother of Moses!
what's this<br>
for?"</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the fever produced by the long and toilsome
journey had<br>
gained considerably on me, and except copious libations of cold
water, I<br>
could touch nothing; my arm, too, was much more painful than
before. Mike<br>
soon perceived that rest and quietness were most important to me
at the<br>
moment, and having with difficulty been prevailed upon to swallow
a few<br>
hurried mouthfuls, the poor fellow disposed cushions around me in
every<br>
imaginable form for comfort; and then, placing my wounded limb in
its<br>
easiest position, he extinguished the lamp, and sat silently down
beside<br>
the hearth, without speaking another word.</p>

<p>Fatigue and exhaustion, more powerful than pain, soon produced
their<br>
effects upon me, and I fell asleep; but it was no refreshing
slumber which<br>
visited my heavy eyelids; the, slow fever of suffering had been
hour by<br>
hour increasing, and my dreams presented nothing but scenes of
agony and<br>
torture. Now I thought that, unhorsed and wounded, I was trampled
beneath<br>
the clanging hoofs of charging cavalry; now I felt the sharp
steel piercing<br>
my flesh, and heard the loud cry of a victorious enemy; then,
methought, I<br>
was stretched upon a litter, covered by gore and mangled by a
grape-shot.<br>
I thought I saw my brother officers approach and look sadly upon
me, while<br>
one, whose face I could not remember, muttered: "I should not
have known<br>
him." The dreadful hospital of Talavera, and all its scenes of
agony, came<br>
up before me, and I thought that I lay waiting my turn for
amputation. This<br>
last impression, more horrible to me than all the rest, made me
spring from<br>
my couch, and I awoke. The cold drops of perspiration stood upon
my brow,<br>
my mouth was parched and open, and my temples throbbed so that I
could<br>
count their beatings; for some seconds I could not throw off the
frightful<br>
illusion I labored under, and it was only by degrees I
recovered<br>
consciousness and remembered where I was. Before me, and on one
side of the<br>
bright wood-fire, sat Mike, who, apparently deep in thought,
gazed fixedly<br>
at the blaze. The start I gave on awaking had not attracted his
attention,<br>
and I could see, as the flickering glare fell upon his features,
that he<br>
was pale and ghastly, while his eyes were riveted upon the fire;
his lips<br>
moved rapidly, as if in prayer, and his locked hands were
pressed<br>
firmly upon his bosom; his voice, at first inaudible, I could
gradually<br>
distinguish, and at length heard the following muttered
sentences:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh, mother of mercy! So far from his home and his people, and
so young to<br>
die in a strange land&mdash;There it is again." Here he appeared
listening<br>
to some sounds from without. "Oh, wirra, wirra, I know it
well!&mdash;the<br>
winding-sheet, the winding-sheet! There it is; my own eyes saw
it!"<br>
The tears coursed fast upon his pale cheeks, and his voice grew
almost<br>
inaudible, as rocking to and fro, for some time he seemed in a
very stupor<br>
of grief; when at last, in a faint, subdued tone, he broke into
one of<br>
those sad and plaintive airs of his country, which only need the
moment of<br>
depression to make them wring the very heart in agony.</p>

<p>His song was that to which Moore has appended the beautiful
lines, "Come<br>
rest on this bosom." The following imperfect translation may
serve to<br>
convey some impression of the words, which in Mike's version were
Irish:&mdash;</p>

<p>    "The day was declining,<br>
    The dark night drew near,<br>
    And the old lord grew sadder<br>
    And paler with fear:<br>
    'Come listen, my daughter,<br>
    Come nearer, oh, near!<br>
    Is't the wind or the water<br>
    That sighs in my ear?'</p>

<p>    "Not the wind nor the water<br>
    Now stirred the night air,<br>
    But a warning far sadder,&mdash;.<br>
    The Banshee was there!<br>
    Now rising, now swelling,<br>
    On the night wind it bore<br>
    One cadence, still telling,<br>
    'I want thee, Rossmore!'</p>

<p>    "And then fast came his breath,<br>
    And more fixed grew his eye;<br>
    And the shadow of death<br>
    Told his hour was nigh.<br>
    Ere the dawn of that morning<br>
    The struggle was o'er,<br>
    For when thrice came the warning<br>
    A corpse was Rossmore!"</p>

<p>The plaintive air to which these words were sung fell heavily
upon my<br>
heart, and it needed but the low and nervous condition I was in
to make me<br>
feel their application to myself. But so it is; the very
superstition your<br>
reason rejects and your sense spurns, has, from old association,
from<br>
habit, and from mere nationality too, a hold upon your hopes and
fears that<br>
demands more firmness and courage than a sick-bed possesses to
combat with<br>
success; and I now listened with an eager ear to mark if the
Banshee<br>
cried, rather than sought to fortify myself by any recurrence to
my own<br>
convictions. Meanwhile Mike's attitude became one of listening
attention.<br>
Not a finger moved; he scarce seemed even to breathe; the state
of suspense<br>
I suffered from was maddening; and at last, unable to bear it
longer, I<br>
was about to speak, when suddenly, from the floor beneath us,
one<br>
long-sustained note swelled upon the air and died away again,
and<br>
immediately after, to the cheerful sounds of a guitar, we heard
the husky<br>
voice of our Portuguese guide indulging himself in a
love-ditty.</p>

<p>Ashamed of myself for my fears, I kept silent; but Mike, who
felt only one<br>
sensation,&mdash;that of unmixed satisfaction at his mistake,&mdash;rubbed
his hands<br>
pleasantly, filled up his glass, drank it, and refilled; while
with an<br>
accent of reassured courage, he briefly remarked,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Well, Mr. Jos&eacute;, if that be singing, upon my conscience
I wonder what<br>
crying is like!"</p>

<p>I could not forbear a laugh at the criticism; and in a moment,
the poor<br>
fellow, who up to that moment believed me sleeping, was beside
me. I saw<br>
from his manner that he dreaded lest I had been listening to his
melancholy<br>
song, and had overheard any of his gloomy forebodings; and as he
cheered<br>
my spirits and spoke encouragingly, I could remark that he made
more than<br>
usual endeavors to appear light-hearted and at ease. Determined,
however,<br>
not to let him escape so easily, I questioned him about his
belief in<br>
ghosts and spirits, at which he endeavored, as he ever did when
the subject<br>
was an unpleasing one, to avoid the discussion; but rather
perceiving that<br>
I indulged in no irreverent disrespect of these matters, he grew
gradually<br>
more open, treating the affair with that strange mixture of
credulity and<br>
mockery which formed his estimate of most things,&mdash;now seeming to
suppose<br>
that any palpable rejection of them might entail sad consequences
in<br>
future, now half ashamed to go the whole length in his
credulity.</p>

<p>"And so, Mike, you never saw a ghost yourself?&mdash;that you
acknowledge?"</p>

<p>"No, sir, I never saw a real ghost; but sure there's many a
thing I never<br>
saw; but Mrs. Moore, the housekeeper, seen two. And your
grandfather that's<br>
gone&mdash;the Lord be good to him!&mdash;used to walk once a year in Lurra
Abbey;<br>
and sure you know the story about Tim Clinchy that was seen every
Saturday<br>
night coming out of the cellar with a candle and a mug of wine
and a pipe<br>
in his mouth, till Mr. Barry laid him. It cost his honor your
uncle ten<br>
pounds in Masses to make him easy; not to speak of a new lock and
two bolts<br>
on the cellar door."</p>

<p>"I have heard all about that; but as you never yourself saw
any of these<br>
things&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But sure my father did, and that's the same any day. My
father seen the<br>
greatest ghost that ever was seen in the county Cork, and spent
the evening<br>
with him, that's more."</p>

<p>"Spent the evening with him!&mdash;what do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Just that, devil a more nor less. If your honor wasn't so
weak, and the<br>
story wasn't a trying one, I'd like to tell it to you."</p>

<p>"Out with it by all means, Mike; I am not disposed to sleep;
and now that<br>
we are upon these matters, my curiosity is strongly excited by
your worthy<br>
father's experience."</p>

<p>Thus encouraged, having trimmed the fire and reseated himself
beside the<br>
blaze, Mike began; but as a ghost is no every-day personage in
our history,<br>
I must give him a chapter to himself.</p>

<br><br><br><br><p>CHAPTER VIII.</p>

<p>THE GHOST.</p>

<p>"Well, I believe your honor heard me tell long ago how my
father left the<br>
army, and the way that he took to another line of life that was
more to his<br>
liking. And so it was, he was happy as the day was long; he drove
a hearse<br>
for Mr. Callaghan of Cork for many years, and a pleasant place it
was; for<br>
ye see, my father was a 'cute man, and knew something of the
world; and<br>
though he was a droll devil, and could sing a funny song when he
was among<br>
the boys, no sooner had he the big black cloak on him and the
weepers, and<br>
he seated on the high box with the six long-tailed blacks before
him, you'd<br>
really think it was his own mother was inside, he looked so
melancholy and<br>
miserable. The sexton and gravedigger was nothing to my father;
and he had<br>
a look about his eye&mdash;to be sure there was a reason for it&mdash;that
you'd<br>
think he was up all night crying; though it's little indulgence
he took<br>
that way.</p>

<p>"Well, of all Mr. Callaghan's men, there was none so great a
favorite as my<br>
father. The neighbors were all fond of him.</p>

<p>"'A kind crayture, every inch of him!' the women would say.
'Did ye see his<br>
face at Mrs. Delany's funeral?'</p>

<p>"'True for you,' another would remark; 'he mistook the road
with grief, and<br>
stopped at a shebeen house instead of Kilmurry church.'</p>

<p>"I need say no more, only one thing,&mdash;that it was principally
among the<br>
farmers and the country people my father was liked so much. The
great<br>
people and the quality&mdash;ax your pardon; but sure isn't it true,
Mister<br>
Charles?&mdash;they don't fret so much after their fathers and
brothers, and<br>
they care little who's driving them, whether it was a decent,
respectable<br>
man like my father, or a chap with a grin on him like a rat-trap.
And so<br>
it happened that my father used to travel half the county; going
here and<br>
there wherever there was trade stirring; and faix, a man didn't
think<br>
himself rightly buried if my father wasn't there; for ye see, he
knew all<br>
about it: he could tell to a quart of spirits what would be
wanting for a<br>
wake; he knew all the good criers for miles round; and I've heard
it was a<br>
beautiful sight to see him standing on a hill, arranging the
procession as<br>
they walked into the churchyard, and giving the word like a
captain,&mdash;</p>

<p>"'Come on, the stiff; now the friends of the stiff; now the
pop'lace.'</p>

<p>"That's what he used to say, and troth he was always repeating
it, when he<br>
was a little gone in drink,&mdash;for that's the time his spirits
would rise,<br>
and he'd think he was burying half Munster.</p>

<p>"And sure it was a real pleasure and a pride to be buried in
them times;<br>
for av it was only a small farmer with a potato garden, my father
would<br>
come down with the black cloak on him, and three yards of crape
behind his<br>
hat, and set all the children crying and yelling for half a mile
round;<br>
and then the way he'd walk before them with a spade on his
shoulder, and<br>
sticking it down in the ground, clap his hat on the top of it, to
make it<br>
look like a chief mourner. It was a beautiful sight!"</p>

<p>"But Mike, if you indulge much longer in this flattering
recollection of<br>
your father, I'm afraid we shall lose sight of the ghost
entirely."</p>

<p>"No fear in life, your honor; I'm coming to him now. Well, it
was this<br>
way it happened: In the winter of the great frost, about
forty-two or<br>
forty-three years ago, the ould priest of Tullonghmurray took ill
and died.<br>
He was sixty years priest of the parish, and mightily beloved by
all<br>
the people, and good reason for it; a pleasanter man, and a
more<br>
social crayture never lived,&mdash;'twas himself was the life of the
whole<br>
country-side. A wedding nor a christening wasn't lucky av he
wasn't there,<br>
sitting at the top of the table, with may be his arm round the
bride<br>
herself, or the baby on his lap, a smoking jug of punch before
him, and as<br>
much kindness in his eye as would make the fortunes of twenty
hypocrites if<br>
they had it among them. And then he was so good to the poor; the
Priory was<br>
always so full of ould men and ould women sitting around the big
fire in<br>
the kitchen that the cook could hardly get near it. There they
were, eating<br>
their meals and burning their shins till they were speckled like
a trout's<br>
back, and grumbling all the time; but Father Dwyer liked them,
and he would<br>
have them.</p>

<p>"'Where have they to go,' he'd say, 'av it wasn't to me? Give
Molly<br>
Kinshela a lock of that bacon. Tim, it's a could morning; will ye
have a<br>
taste of the "dew?"'</p>

<p>"Ah, that's the way he'd spake to them; but sure goodness is
no warrant<br>
for living, any more than devilment, and so he got could in his
feet at a<br>
station, and he rode home in the heavy snow without his big
coat,&mdash;for he<br>
gave it away to a blind man on the road; in three days he was
dead.</p>

<p>"I see you're getting impatient, so I'll not stop to say what
grief was<br>
in the parish when it was known; but troth, there never was seen
the like<br>
before,&mdash;not a crayture would lift a spade for two days, and
there was more<br>
whiskey sold in that time than at the whole spring fair. Well, on
the third<br>
day the funeral set out, and never was the equal of it in them
parts:<br>
first, there was my father,&mdash;he came special from Cork with the
six horses<br>
all in new black, and plumes like little poplar-trees,&mdash;then came
Father<br>
Dwyer, followed by the two coadjutors in beautiful surplices,
walking<br>
bare-headed, with the little boys of the Priory school,
two-and-two."</p>

<p>"Well, Mike, I'm sure it was very fine; but for Heaven's sake,
spare me all<br>
these descriptions, and get on to the ghost!"</p>

<p>"'Faith, yer honor's in a great hurry for the ghost,&mdash;may be
ye won't like<br>
him when ye have him; but I'll go faster, if ye please. Well,
Father Dwyer,<br>
ye see, was born at Aghan-lish, of an ould family, and he left it
in his<br>
will that he was to be buried in the family vault; and as
Aghan-lish was<br>
eighteen miles up the mountains, it was getting late when they
drew near.<br>
By that time the great procession was all broke up and gone home.
The<br>
coadjutors stopped to dine at the 'Blue Bellows' at the
cross-roads; the<br>
little boys took to pelting snowballs; there was a fight or two
on the way<br>
besides,&mdash;and in fact, except an ould deaf fellow that my father
took to<br>
mind the horses, he was quite alone. Not that he minded that
same; for when<br>
the crowd was gone, my father began to sing a droll song, and
told the deaf<br>
chap that it was a lamentation. At last they came in sight of
Aghan-lish.<br>
It was a lonesome, melancholy-looking place with nothing near it
except two<br>
or three ould fir-trees and a small slated house with one window,
where the<br>
sexton lived, and even that was shut up and a padlock on the
door. Well,<br>
my father was not over much pleased at the look of matters; but
as he was<br>
never hard put to what to do, he managed to get the coffin into
the vestry,<br>
and then when he had unharnessed the horses, he sent the deaf
fellow with<br>
them down to the village to tell the priest that the corpse was
there, and<br>
to come up early in the morning and perform Mass. The next thing
to do was<br>
to make himself comfortable for the night; and then he made a
roaring fire<br>
on the ould hearth,&mdash;for there was plenty of bog-fir
there,&mdash;closed the<br>
windows with the black cloaks, and wrapping two round himself, he
sat down<br>
to cook a little supper he brought with him in case of need.</p>

<p>"Well, you may think it was melancholy enough to pass the
night up there<br>
alone with a corpse, in an ould ruined church in the middle of
the<br>
mountains, the wind howling about on every side, and the
snowdrift beating<br>
against the walls; but as the fire burned brightly, and the
little plate of<br>
rashers and eggs smoked temptingly before him, my father mixed a
jug of the<br>
strongest punch, and sat down as happy as a king. As long as he
was eating<br>
away he had no time to be thinking of anything else; but when all
was done,<br>
and he looked about him, he began to feel very low and melancholy
in his<br>
heart. There was the great black coffin on three chairs in one
corner; and<br>
then the mourning cloaks that he had stuck up against the windows
moved<br>
backward and forward like living things; and outside, the wild
cry of the<br>
plover as he flew past, and the night-owl sitting in a nook of
the old<br>
church. 'I wish it was morning, anyhow,' said my father, 'for
this is a<br>
lonesome place to be in; and faix, he'll be a cunning fellow that
catches<br>
me passing the night this way again.' Now there was one thing
distressed<br>
him most of all,&mdash;my father used always to make fun of the ghosts
and<br>
sperits the neighbors would tell of, pretending there was no such
thing;<br>
and now the thought came to him, 'May be they'll revenge
themselves on me<br>
to-night when they have me up here alone;' and with that he made
another<br>
jug stronger than the first, and tried to remember a few prayers
in case of<br>
need, but somehow his mind was not too clear, and he said
afterwards he<br>
was always mixing up ould songs and toasts with the prayers, and
when he<br>
thought he had just got hold of a beautiful psalm, it would turn
out to be<br>
'Tatter Jack Walsh' or 'Limping James' or something like that.
The storm,<br>
meanwhile, was rising every moment, and parts of the old abbey
were falling<br>
as the wind shook the ruin; and my father's spirits,
notwithstanding the<br>
punch, wore lower than ever.</p>

<p>"'I made it too weak,' said he, as he set to work on a new
jorum; and<br>
troth, this time that was not the fault of it, for the first sup
nearly<br>
choked him.</p>

<p>"'Ah,' said he, now, 'I knew what it was; this is like the
thing; and Mr.<br>
Free, you are beginning to feel easy and comfortable. Pass the
jar. Your<br>
very good health and song. I'm a little hoarse, it's true, but if
the<br>
company will excuse&mdash;'</p>

<p>"And then he began knocking on the table with his knuckles, as
if there was<br>
a room full of people asking him to sing. In short, my father was
drunk as<br>
a fiddler; the last brew finished him; and he began roaring away
all kinds<br>
of droll songs, and telling all manner of stories as if he was at
a great<br>
party.</p>

<p>"While he was capering this way about the room, he knocked
down his hat,<br>
and with it a pack of cards he put into it before leaving home,
for he was<br>
mighty fond of a game.</p>

<p>"'Will ye take a hand, Mr. Free?' said he, as he gathered them
up and sat<br>
down beside the fire.</p>

<p>"'I'm convanient,' said he, and began dealing out as if there
was a partner<br>
fornenst him.</p>

<p>"When my father used to get this far in the story, he became
very confused.<br>
He says that once or twice he mistook the liquor, and took a pull
at the<br>
bottle of poteen instead of the punch; and the last thing he
remembers was<br>
asking poor Father Dwyer if he would draw near to the fire, and
not be<br>
lying there near the door.</p>

<p>"With that he slipped down on the ground and fell fast asleep.
How long he<br>
lay that way he could never tell. When he awoke and looked up,
his hair<br>
nearly stood on an end with fright. What do you think he seen
fornenst him,<br>
sitting at the other side of the fire, but Father Dwyer himself.
There he<br>
was, divil a lie in it, wrapped up in one of the mourning cloaks,
trying to<br>
warm his hands at the fire. "'<i>Salve hoc nomine patri!</i>' said my
father,<br>
crossing himself, 'av it's your ghost, God presarve me!'</p>

<p>"'Good-evening t'ye, Mr. Free,' said the ghost; 'and av I
might be bould,<br>
what's in the jug?'&mdash;for ye see, my father had it under his arm
fast, and<br>
never let it go when he was asleep.</p>

<p>"'<i>Pater noster qui es in</i>,&mdash;poteen, sir,' said my father; for
the ghost<br>
didn't look pleased at his talking Latin.</p>

<p>"'Ye might have the politeness to ax if one had a mouth on
him, then,' says<br>
the ghost.</p>

<p>"'Sure, I didn't think the likes of you would taste
sperits.'</p>

<p>"'Try me,' said the ghost; and with that he filled out a
glass, and tossed<br>
it off like a Christian.</p>

<p>"'Beamish!' says the ghost, smacking his lips.</p>

<p>"'The same,' says my father; 'and sure what's happened you has
not spoiled<br>
your taste.'</p>

<p>"'If you'd mix a little hot,' says the ghost, 'I'm thinking it
would be<br>
better,&mdash;the night is mighty sevare.'</p>

<p>"'Anything that your reverance pleases,' says my father, as he
began to<br>
blow up a good fire to boil the water.</p>

<p>"'And what news is stirring?' says the ghost.</p>

<p>"'Devil a word, your reverance,&mdash;your own funeral was the only
thing doing<br>
last week. Times is bad; except the measles, there's nothing in
our parts.'</p>

<p>"'And we're quite dead hereabouts, too,' says the ghost.</p>

<p>"'There's some of us so, anyhow, says my father, with a sly
look. 'Taste<br>
that, your reverance.'</p>

<p>"'Pleasant and refreshing,' says the ghost; 'and now, Mr.
Free, what do you<br>
say to a little "spoilt five," or "beggar my neighbor"?'</p>

<p>"'What will we play for? 'says my father, for a thought just
struck<br>
him,&mdash;'may be it's some trick of the Devil to catch my soul.'</p>

<p>"'A pint of Beamish,' says the ghost.</p>

<p>"'Done!' says my father; 'cut for deal. The ace of clubs,&mdash;you
have it.'</p>

<p>"Now the whole time the ghost was dealing the cards, my father
never took<br>
his eyes off of him, for he wasn't quite aisy in his mind at all;
but when<br>
he saw him turn up the trump, and take a strong drink afterwards,
he got<br>
more at ease, and began the game.</p>

<p>"How long they played it was never rightly known; but one
thing is sure,<br>
they drank a cruel deal of sperits. Three quart bottles my father
brought<br>
with him were all finished, and by that time his brain was so
confused with<br>
the liquor, and all he lost,&mdash;for somehow he never won a
game,&mdash;that he was<br>
getting very quarrelsome.</p>

<p>"'You have your own luck to it,' says he, at last.</p>

<p>"'True for you; and besides, we play a great deal where I come
from.'</p>

<p>"'I've heard so,' says my father. 'I lead the knave, sir;
spades! Bad cess<br>
to it, lost again!'</p>

<p>"Now it was really very distressing; for by this time, though
they only<br>
began for a pint of Beamish, my father went on betting till he
lost the<br>
hearse and all the six horses, mourning cloaks, plumes, and
everything.</p>

<p>"'Are you tired, Mr. Free? May be you'd like to stop?'</p>

<p>"'Stop! faith it's a nice time to stop; of course not.'</p>

<p>"'Well, what will ye play for now?'</p>

<p>"The way he said these woods brought a trembling all over my
father, and<br>
his blood curdled in his heart. 'Oh, murther!' says he to
himself, 'it's my<br>
sowl he's wanting all the time.'</p>

<p>"'I've mighty little left,' says my father, looking at him
keenly, while he<br>
kept shuffling the cards quick as lightning.</p>

<p>"'Mighty little; no matter, we'll give you plenty of time to
pay,&mdash;and if<br>
you can't do it, it shall never trouble you as long as you
live.'</p>

<p>"'Oh, you murthering devil!' says my father, flying at him
with a spade<br>
that he had behind his chair, 'I've found you out.'</p>

<p>"With one blow he knocked him down, and now a terrible fight
begun, for the<br>
ghost was very strong, too; but my father's blood was up, and
he'd have<br>
faced the Devil himself then. They rolled over each other several
times,<br>
the broken bottles cutting them to pieces, and the chairs and
tables<br>
crashing under them. At last the ghost took the bottle that lay
on the<br>
hearth, and levelled my father to the ground with one blow. Down
he fell,<br>
and the bottle and the whiskey were both dashed into the fire.
That was<br>
the end of it, for the ghost disappeared that moment in a blue
flame that<br>
nearly set fire to my father as he lay on the floor.</p>

<p>"Och, it was a cruel sight to see him next morning, with his
cheek cut open<br>
and his hands all bloody, lying there by himself,&mdash;all the broken
glass and<br>
the cards all round him,&mdash;the coffin, too, was knocked down off
the chair,<br>
may be the ghost had trouble getting into it. However that was,
the funeral<br>
was put off for a day, for my father couldn't speak; and as for
the sexton,<br>
it was a queer thing, but when they came to call him in the
morning, he had<br>
two black eyes, and a gash over his ear, and he never knew how he
got them.<br>
It was easy enough to know the ghost did it; but my father kept
the secret,<br>
and never told it to any man, woman, or child in them parts."</p>

<br><br><br><br><p>CHAPTER IX.</p>

<p>LISBON.</p>

<p>I have little power to trace the events which occupied the
succeeding three<br>
weeks of my history. The lingering fever which attended my wound
detained<br>
me during that time at the ch&acirc;teau; and when at last I did
leave for<br>
Lisbon, the winter was already beginning, and it was upon a cold
raw<br>
evening that I once more took possession of my old quarters at
the Quay de<br>
Soderi.</p>

<p>My eagerness and anxiety to learn something of the campaign
was ever<br>
uppermost, and no sooner had I reached my destination than I
despatched<br>
Mike to the quartermaster's office to pick up some news, and hear
which of<br>
my friends and brother officers were then at Lisbon. I was
sitting in a<br>
state of nervous impatience watching for his return, when at
length I heard<br>
footsteps approaching my room, and the next moment Mike's voice,
saying,<br>
"The ould room, sir, where he was before." The door suddenly
opened, and my<br>
friend Power stood before me.</p>

<p>"Charley, my boy!"&mdash;"Fred, my fine fellow!" was all either
could say for<br>
some minutes. Upon my part, the recollection of his bold and
manly bearing<br>
in my behalf choked all utterance; while upon his, my haggard
cheek and<br>
worn look produced an effect so sudden and unexpected that he
became<br>
speechless.</p>

<p>In a few minutes, however, we both rallied, and opened our
store of mutual<br>
remembrances since we parted. My career I found he was perfectly
acquainted<br>
with, and his consisted of nothing but one unceasing round of
gayety and<br>
pleasure. Lisbon had been delightful during the summer,&mdash;parties
to Cintra,<br>
excursions through the surrounding country, were of daily
occurrence; and<br>
as my friend was a favorite everywhere, his life was one of
continued<br>
amusement.</p>

<p>"Do you know, Charley, had it been any other man than
yourself, I should<br>
not have spared him; for I have fallen head over ears in love
with your<br>
little dark-eyed Portuguese."</p>

<p>"Ah, Donna Inez, you mean?"</p>

<p>"Yes, it is she I mean, and you need not affect such an air of
uncommon<br>
<i>nonchalance</i>. She's the loveliest girl in Lisbon, and with
fortune to pay<br>
off all the mortgages in Connemara."</p>

<p>"Oh, faith! I admire her amazingly; but as I never flattered
myself upon<br>
any preference&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Come, come, Charley, no concealment, my old fellow; every one
knows the<br>
thing's settled. Your old friend, Sir George Dashwood, told me
yesterday."</p>

<p>"Yesterday! Why, is he here, at Lisbon?"</p>

<p>"To be sure he is; didn't I tell you that before? Confound it,
what a head<br>
I have! Why, man, he's come out as deputy adjutant-general; but
for him I<br>
should not have got renewed leave."</p>

<p>"And Miss Dashwood, is she here?"</p>

<p>"Yes, she came with him. By Jove, how handsome she is,&mdash;quite
a different<br>
style of thing from our dark friend, but, to my thinking, even
handsomer.<br>
Hammersley seems of my opinion, too."</p>

<p>"How! Is Hammersley at Lisbon?"</p>

<p>"On the staff here. But, confound it, what makes you so red,
you have no<br>
ill-feeling towards him now. I know he speaks most warmly of you;
no later<br>
than last night, at Sir George's&mdash;"</p>

<p>What Power was about to add I know not, for I sprang from my
chair with a<br>
sudden start, and walked to the window, to conceal my agitation
from him.</p>

<p>"And so," said I, at length regaining my composure in some
measure, "Sir<br>
George also spoke of my name in connection with the senhora?"</p>

<p>"To be sure he did. All Lisbon does. What can you mean? But I
see, my dear<br>
boy; you know you are not of the strongest, and we've been
talking far too<br>
long. Come now, Charley, I'll say good-night. I'll be with you at
breakfast<br>
to-morrow, and tell you all the gossip; meanwhile promise me to
get quietly<br>
to bed, and so good-night."</p>

<p>Such was the conflicting state of feeling I suffered from that
I made no<br>
effort to detain Power. I longed to be once more alone, to think,
calmly if<br>
I could, over the position I stood in, and to resolve upon my
plans for the<br>
future.</p>

<p>My love for Lucy Dashwood had been long rather a devotion than
a hope. My<br>
earliest dawn of manly ambition was associated with the first
hour I met<br>
her. She it was who first touched my boyish heart, and suggested
a sense<br>
of chivalrous ardor within me; and even though lost to me
forever, I could<br>
still regard her as the mainspring of my actions, and dwell upon
my passion<br>
as the thing that hallowed every enterprise of my life.</p>

<p>In a word, my love, however little it might reach her heart,
was everything<br>
to mine. It was the worship of the devotee to his protecting
saint. It was<br>
the faith that made me rise above misfortune and mishap, and led
me onward;<br>
and in this way I could have borne anything, everything, rather
than the<br>
imputation of fickleness.</p>

<p>Lucy might not&mdash;nay, I felt she did not&mdash;love me. It was
possible that some<br>
other was preferred before me; but to doubt my own affection, to
suspect my<br>
own truth, was to destroy all the charm of my existence, and to
extinguish<br>
within me forever the enthusiasm that made me a hero to my own
heart.</p>

<p>It may seem but poor philosophy; but alas, how many of our
happiest, how<br>
many of our brightest thoughts here are but delusions like this!
The<br>
dayspring of youth gilds the tops of the distant mountains before
us, and<br>
many a weary day through life, when clouds and storms are
thickening around<br>
us, we live upon the mere memory of the past. Some fast-flitting
prospect<br>
of a bright future, some passing glimpse of a sunlit valley,
tinges all our<br>
after-years.</p>

<p>It is true that he will suffer fewer disappointments, he will
incur fewer<br>
of the mishaps of the world, who indulges in no fancies such as
these; but<br>
equally true is it that he will taste none of that exuberant
happiness<br>
which is that man's portion who weaves out a story of his life,
and who, in<br>
connecting the promise of early years with the performance of
later, will<br>
seek to fulfil a fate and destiny.</p>

<p>Weaving such fancies, I fell sound asleep, nor woke before the
stir and<br>
bustle of the great city aroused me. Power, I found, had been
twice at my<br>
quarters that morning, but fearing to disturb me, had merely left
a few<br>
lines to say that, as he should be engaged on service during the
day,<br>
we could not meet before the evening. There were certain
preliminaries<br>
requisite regarding my leave which demanded my appearing before a
board of<br>
medical officers, and I immediately set about dressing; resolving
that, as<br>
soon as they were completed, I should, if permitted, retire to
one of the<br>
small cottages on the opposite bank of the Tagus, there to remain
until my<br>
restored health allowed me to rejoin my regiment.</p>

<p>I dreaded meeting the Dashwoods. I anticipated with a heavy
heart how<br>
effectually one passing interview would destroy all my day-dreams
of<br>
happiness, and I preferred anything to the sad conviction of
hopelessness<br>
such a meeting must lead to.</p>

<p>While I thus balanced with myself how to proceed, a gentle
step came to the<br>
door, and as it opened slowly, a servant in a dark livery
entered.</p>

<p>"Mr. O'Malley, sir?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said I, wondering to whom my arrival could be thus
early known.</p>

<p>"Sir George Dashwood requests you will step over to him as
soon as you go<br>
out," continued the man; "he is so engaged that he cannot leave
home, but<br>
is most desirous to see you."</p>

<p>"It is not far from here?"</p>

<p>"No, sir; scarcely five minutes' walk."</p>

<p>"Well, then, if you will show me the way, I'll follow
you."</p>

<p>I cast one passing glance at myself to see that all was right
about my<br>
costume, and sallied forth.</p>

<p>In the middle of the Black Horse Square, at the door of a
large,<br>
stone-fronted building, a group of military men were assembled,
chatting<br>
and laughing away together,&mdash;some reading the lately-arrived
English<br>
papers; others were lounging upon the stone parapet, carelessly
puffing<br>
their cigars. None of the faces were known to me; so threading my
way<br>
through the crowd, I reached the steps. Just as I did so, a
half-muttered<br>
whisper met my ear:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Who did you say?"</p>

<p>"O'Malley, the young Irishman who behaved so gallantly at the
Douro."</p>

<p>The blood rushed hotly to my cheek, my heart bounded with
exultation; my<br>
step, infirm and tottering but a moment before, became fixed and
steady,<br>
and I felt a thrill of proud enthusiasm playing through my veins.
How<br>
little did the speaker of those few and random words know what
courage he<br>
had given to a drooping heart, what renewed energy to a breaking
spirit!<br>
The voice of praise, too, coming from those to whom we had
thought<br>
ourselves unknown, has a magic about it that must be felt to be
understood.<br>
So it happened that in a few seconds a revolution had taken place
in all<br>
my thoughts and feelings, and I, who had left my quarters
dispirited and<br>
depressed, now walked confidently and proudly forward.</p>

<p>"Mr. O'Malley, sir," said the servant to the officer waiting,
as we entered<br>
the antechamber.</p>

<p>"Ah, Mr. O'Malley," said the aide-de-damp, in his blandest
accent, "I hope<br>
you're better. Sir George is most anxious to see you; he is at
present<br>
engaged with the staff&mdash;"</p>

<p>A bell rang at that moment, and cut short the sentence; he
flew to the door<br>
of the inner room, and returning in an instant, said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Will you follow me? This way, if you please."</p>

<p>The room was crowded with general officers and aides-de-camp,
so that for<br>
a second or two I could not distinguish the parties; but no
sooner was my<br>
name announced, than Sir George Dashwood, forcing his way
through, rushed<br>
forward to meet me.</p>

<p>"O'Malley, my brave fellow, delighted to shake your hand
again! How much<br>
grown you are,&mdash;twice the man I knew you; and the arm, too, is it
getting<br>
on well?"</p>

<p>Scarcely giving me a moment to reply, and still holding my
hand tightly in<br>
his grasp, he introduced me on every side.</p>

<p>"My young Irish friend, Sir Edward, the man of the Douro. My
Lord, allow me<br>
to present Lieutenant O'Malley, of the Fourteenth."</p>

<p>"A very dashing thing, that of yours, sir, at Ciudad
Rodrigo."</p>

<p>"A very senseless one, I fear, my Lord."</p>

<p>"No, no, I don't agree with you at all; even when no great
results follow,<br>
the <i>morale</i> of an army benefits by acts of daring."</p>

<p>A running fire of kind and civil speeches poured in on me from
all<br>
quarters, and amidst all that crowd of bronzed and war-worn
veterans, I<br>
felt myself the lion of the moment. Crawfurd, it appeared, had
spoken most<br>
handsomely of my name, and I was thus made known to many of those
whose own<br>
reputations were then extending over Europe.</p>

<p>In this happy trance of excited pleasure I passed the morning.
Amidst<br>
the military chit-chat of the day around me, treated as an equal
by the<br>
greatest and the most distinguished, I heard all the confidential
opinions<br>
upon the campaign and its leaders; and in that most entrancing
of<br>
all flatteries,&mdash;the easy tone of companionship of our elders
and<br>
betters,&mdash;forgot my griefs, and half believed I was destined for
great<br>
things.</p>

<p>Fearing, at length, that I had prolonged my visit too far, I
approached<br>
Sir George to take my leave, when, drawing my arm within his, he
retired<br>
towards one of the windows.</p>

<p>"A word, O'Malley, before you go. I've arranged a little plan
for you;<br>
mind, I shall insist upon obedience. They'll make some difficulty
about<br>
your remaining here, so that I have appointed you one of our
extra<br>
aides-de-camp. That will free you from all trouble, and I shall
not be very<br>
exacting in my demands upon you. You must, however, commence your
duties<br>
to-day, and as we dine at seven precisely, I shall expect you. I
am<br>
aware of your wish to stay in Lisbon, my boy, and if all I hear
be true,<br>
congratulate you sincerely; but more of this another time, and so
good-by."<br>
So saying, he shook my hand once more, warmly; and without well
feeling how<br>
or why, I found myself in the street.</p>

<p>The last few words Sir George had spoken threw a gloom over
all my<br>
thoughts. I saw at once that the report Power had alluded to had
gained<br>
currency at Lisbon. Sir George believed it; doubtless, Lucy, too;
and<br>
forgetting in an instant all the emulative ardor that so lately
stirred my<br>
heart, I took my path beside the river, and sauntered slowly
along, lost in<br>
my reflections.</p>

<p>I had walked for above an hour before paying any attention to
the path I<br>
followed. Mechanically, as it were, retreating from the noise and
tumult-of<br>
the city, I wandered towards the country. My thoughts fixed but
upon<br>
one theme, I had neither ears nor eyes for aught around me; the
great<br>
difficulty of my present position now appearing to me in this
light,&mdash;my<br>
attachment to Lucy Dashwood, unrequited and unreturned as I felt
it,<br>
did not permit of my rebutting any report which might have
reached her<br>
concerning Donna Inez. I had no right, no claim to suppose her
sufficiently<br>
interested about me to listen to such an explanation, had I even
the<br>
opportunity to make it. One thing was thus clear to me,&mdash;all my
hopes had<br>
ended in that quarter; and as this conclusion sank into my mind,
a species<br>
of dogged resolution to brave my fortune crept upon me, which
only waited<br>
the first moment of my meeting her to overthrow and destroy
forever.</p>

<p>Meanwhile I walked on,&mdash;now rapidly, as some momentary rush of
passionate<br>
excitement, now slowly, as some depressing and gloomy notion
succeeded;<br>
when suddenly my path was arrested by a long file of bullock cars
which<br>
blocked up the way. Some chance squabble had arisen among the
drivers, and<br>
to avoid the crowd and collision, I turned into a gateway which
opened<br>
beside me, and soon found myself in a lawn handsomely planted and
adorned<br>
with flowering shrubs and ornamental trees.</p>

<p>In the half-dreamy state my musings had brought me to, I
struggled to<br>
recollect why the aspect of the place did not seem altogether
new. My<br>
thoughts were, however, far away,&mdash;now blending some memory of my
distant<br>
home with scenes of battle and bloodshed, or resting upon my
first<br>
interview with her whose chance word, carelessly and lightly
spoken, had<br>
written the story of my life. From this revery I was rudely
awakened by a<br>
rustling noise in the trees behind me, and before I could turn my
head, the<br>
two fore-paws of a large stag-hound were planted upon my
shoulders, while<br>
the open mouth and panting tongue were close beside my face. My
day-dream<br>
was dispelled quick as lightning; it was Juan, himself, the
favorite dog of<br>
the senhora, who gave me this rude welcome, and who now, by a
thousand wild<br>
gestures and bounding caresses, seemed to do the honors of his
house. There<br>
was something so like home in these joyful greetings that I
yielded myself<br>
at once his prisoner, and followed, or rather was accompanied by
him<br>
towards the villa.</p>

<p>Of course, sooner or later, I should have called upon my kind
friends; then<br>
why not now, when chance has already brought me so near? Besides,
if I<br>
held to my resolution, which I meant to do,&mdash;of retiring to some
quiet and<br>
sequestered cottage till my health was restored,&mdash;the opportunity
might not<br>
readily present itself again. This line of argument perfectly
satisfied my<br>
reason; while a strong feeling of something like curiosity piqued
me to<br>
proceed, and before many minutes elapsed, I reached the house.
The door, as<br>
usual, lay wide open; and the ample hall, furnished like a
sitting-room,<br>
had its customary litter of books, music, and flowers scattered
upon the<br>
tables. My friend Juan, however, suffered me not to linger here,
but<br>
rushing furiously at a door before me, began a vigorous attack
for<br>
admittance.</p>

<p>As I knew this to be the drawing-room, I opened the door and
walked in, but<br>
no one was to be seen; a half-open book lay upon an ottoman, and
a fan,<br>
which I recognized as an old acquaintance, was beside it, but the
owner was<br>
absent.</p>

<p>I sat down, resolved to wait patiently for her coming, without
any<br>
announcement of my being there. I was not sorry, indeed, to have
some<br>
moments to collect my thoughts, and restore my erring faculties
to<br>
something like order.</p>

<p>As I looked about the room, it seemed as if I had been there
but yesterday.<br>
The folding-doors lay open to the garden, just as I had seen them
last; and<br>
save that the flowers seemed fewer, and those which remained of a
darker<br>
and more sombre tint, all seemed unchanged. There lay the guitar
to whose<br>
thrilling chords my heart had bounded; there, the drawing over
which I had<br>
bent in admiring pleasure, suggesting some tints of light or
shadow, as the<br>
fairy fingers traced them; every chair was known to me, and I
greeted them<br>
as things I cared for.</p>

<p>While thus I scanned each object around me, I was struck by a
little china<br>
vase which, unlike its other brethren, contained a bouquet of
dead and<br>
faded flowers; the blood rushed to my cheek; I started up; it was
one I had<br>
myself presented to her the day before we parted. It was in that
same vase<br>
I placed it; the very table, too, stood in the same position
beside that<br>
narrow window. What a rush of thoughts came pouring on me! And
oh!&mdash;shall I<br>
confess it?&mdash;how deeply did such a mute testimony of remembrance
speak<br>
to my heart, at the moment that I felt myself unloved and uncared
for by<br>
another! I walked hurriedly up and down, a maze of conflicting
resolves<br>
combating in my mind, while one thought ever recurred: "Would
that I had<br>
not come there!" and yet after all it may mean nothing; some
piece of<br>
passing coquetry which she will be the very first to laugh at. I
remembered<br>
how she spoke of poor Howard; what folly to take it otherwise!
"Be it so,<br>
then," said I, half aloud; "and now for my part of the game;" and
with this<br>
I took from my pocket the light-blue scarf she had given me the
morning we<br>
parted, and throwing it over my shoulder, prepared to perform my
part in<br>
what I had fully persuaded myself to be a comedy. The time,
however, passed<br>
on, and she came not; a thousand high-flown Portuguese phrases
had time to<br>
be conned over again and again by me, and I had abundant leisure
to enact<br>
my coming part; but still the curtain did not rise. As the day
was wearing,<br>
I resolved at last to write a few lines, expressive of my regret
at not<br>
meeting her, and promising myself an early opportunity of paying
my<br>
respects under more fortunate circumstances. I sat down
accordingly, and<br>
drawing the paper towards me, began in a mixture of French and
Portuguese,<br>
as it happened, to indite my billet.</p>

<p>"Senhora Inez&mdash;" no&mdash;"Ma ch&egrave;re Mademoiselle Inez&mdash;"
confound it, that's too<br>
intimate; well, here goes: "Monsieur O'Malley presente ses
respects&mdash;" that<br>
will never do; and then, after twenty other abortive attempts, I
began<br>
thoughtlessly sketching heads upon the paper, and scribbling with
wonderful<br>
facility in fifty different ways: "Ma charmante amie&mdash;Ma plus
ch&egrave;re Inez,"<br>
etc., and in this most useful and profitable occupation did I
pass another<br>
half-hour.</p>

<p>How long I should have persisted in such an employment it is
difficult to<br>
say, had not an incident intervened which suddenly but most
effectually put<br>
an end to it. As the circumstance is one which, however little
striking in<br>
itself, had the greatest and most lasting influence upon my
future career,<br>
I shall, perhaps, be excused in devoting another chapter to its
recital.</p>

<br><br><br><br><p>CHAPTER X.</p>

<p>A PLEASANT PREDICAMENT.</p>

<p>As I sat vainly endeavoring to fix upon some suitable and
appropriate<br>
epithet by which to commence my note, my back was turned towards
the door<br>
of the garden; and so occupied was I in my meditations, that even
had any<br>
one entered at the time, in all probability I should not have
perceived it.<br>
At length, however, I was aroused from my study by a burst of
laughter,<br>
whose girlish joyousness was not quite new to me. I knew it well;
it was<br>
the senhora herself; and the next moment I heard her voice.</p>

<p>"I tell you, I'm quite certain I saw his face in the mirror as
I passed.<br>
Oh, how delightful! and you'll be charmed with him; so, mind, you
must not<br>
steal him from me; I shall never forgive you if you do; and look,
only<br>
look! he has got the blue scarf I gave him when he marched to the
Douro."</p>

<p>While I perceived that I was myself seen, I could see nothing
of the<br>
speaker, and wishing to hear something further, appeared more
than ever<br>
occupied in the writing before me.</p>

<p>What her companion replied I could not, however, catch, but
only guess at<br>
its import by the senhora's answer. "<i>Fi done!</i>&mdash;I really am very
fond of<br>
him; but, never fear, I shall be as stately as a queen. You shall
see how<br>
meekly he will kiss my hand, and with what unbending reserve I'll
receive<br>
him."</p>

<p>"Indeed!" thought I; "mayhap, I'll mar your plot a little; but
let us<br>
listen."</p>

<p>Again her friend spoke, but too low to be heard.</p>

<p>"It is so provoking," continued Inez; "I never can remember
names, and his<br>
was something too absurd; but never mind, I shall make him a
grandee of<br>
Portugal. Well, but come along, I long to present him to
you."</p>

<p>Here a gentle struggle seemed to ensue; for I heard the
senhora coaxingly<br>
entreat her, while her companion steadily resisted.</p>

<p>"I know very well you think I shall be so silly, and perhaps
wrong; eh, is<br>
it not so? but you are quite mistaken. You'll be surprised at my
cold and<br>
dignified manner. I shall draw myself proudly up, thus, and
curtsying<br>
deeply, say, 'Monsieur, j'ai l' honneur de vous saluer.'"</p>

<p>A laugh twice as mirthful as before interrupted her account of
herself,<br>
while I could hear the tones of her friend evidently in
expostulation.</p>

<a name="0083"></a>
<img alt="0083.jpg (166K)" src="0083.jpg" height="641" width="777">

<p>[O'MALLEY FOLLOWING THE CUSTOM OF HIS COUNTRY.]</p>
<br><br>
<p>"Well, then, to be sure, you are provoking, but you really
promise to<br>
follow me. Be it so; then give me that moss-rose. How you have
fluttered<br>
me; now for it!"</p>

<p>So saying, I heard her foot upon the gravel, and the next
instant upon the<br>
marble step of the door. There is something in expectation that
sets the<br>
heart beating, and mine throbbed against my side. I waited,
however, till<br>
she entered, before lifting my head, and then springing suddenly
up, with<br>
one bound clasped her in my arms, and pressing my lips upon her
roseate<br>
cheek, said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"<i>Mar charmante amie!</i>" To disengage herself from me, and to
spring<br>
suddenly back was her first effort; to burst into an immoderate
fit of<br>
laughing, her second; her cheek was, however, covered with a deep
blush,<br>
and I already repented that my malice had gone so far.</p>

<p>"Pardon, Mademoiselle," said I, in affected innocence, "if I
have so far<br>
forgotten myself as to assume a habit of my own country to a
stranger."</p>

<p>A half-angry toss of the head was her only reply, and turning
towards the<br>
garden, she called to her friend:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Come here, dearest, and instruct my ignorance upon your
national customs;<br>
but first let me present to you,&mdash;never know his name,&mdash;the
Chevalier de<br>
&mdash;&mdash;What is it?"</p>

<p>The glass door opened as she spoke; a tall and graceful figure
entered, and<br>
turning suddenly round, showed me the features of Lucy Dashwood.
We both<br>
stood opposite each other, each mute with amazement. <i>My</i>
feelings let me<br>
not attempt to convey; shame, for the first moment stronger than
aught<br>
else, sent the blood rushing to my face and temples, and the next
I was<br>
cold and pale as death. As for her, I cannot guess at what passed
in<br>
her mind. She curtsied deeply to me, and with a half-smile of
scarce<br>
recognition passed by me, and walked towards a window.</p>

<p>"<i>Comme vous &ecirc;tes amiable!</i>" said the lively Portuguese,
who comprehended<br>
little of this dumb show; "here have I been flattering myself
what friends<br>
you'd be the very moment you meet, and now you'll not even look
at each<br>
other."</p>

<p>What was to be done? The situation was every instant growing
more and more<br>
embarrassing; nothing but downright effrontery could get through
with<br>
it now; and never did a man's heart more fail him than did mine
at this<br>
conjuncture. I made the' effort, however, and stammered out
certain<br>
unmeaning commonplaces. Inez replied, and I felt myself
conversing with the<br>
headlong recklessness of one marching to a scaffold, a coward's
fear at his<br>
heart, while he essayed to seem careless and indifferent.</p>

<p>Anxious to reach what I esteemed safe ground, I gladly
adverted to the<br>
campaign; and at last, hurried on by the impulse to cover my
embarrassment,<br>
was describing some skirmish with a French outpost. Without
intending, I<br>
had succeeded in exciting the senhora's interest, and she
listened with<br>
sparkling eye and parted lips to the description of a sweeping
charge in<br>
which a square was broken, and several prisoners carried off.
Warming with<br>
the eager avidity of her attention, I grew myself more excited,
when just<br>
as my narrative reached its climax, Miss Dashwood walked gently
towards the<br>
bell, rang it, and ordered her carriage. The tone of perfect
<i>nonchalance</i><br>
of the whole proceeding struck me dumb; I faltered, stammered,
hesitated,<br>
and was silent. Donna Inez turned from one to the other of us
with a look<br>
of unfeigned astonishment and I heard her mutter to herself
something<br>
like a reflection upon "national eccentricities." Happily,
however,<br>
her attention was now exclusively turned towards her friend, and
while<br>
assisting her to shawl, and extorting innumerable promises of an
early<br>
visit, I got a momentary reprieve; the carriage drew up also, and
as the<br>
gravel flew right and left beneath the horses' feet, the very
noise and<br>
bustle relieved me. "<i>Adios</i>," then said Inez, as she kissed her
for the<br>
last time, while she motioned to me to escort her to her
carriage. I<br>
advanced, stopped, made another step forward, and again grew
irresolute;<br>
but Miss Dashwood speedily terminated the difficulty; for making
me a<br>
formal curtsey, she declined my scarce-proffered attention, and
left the<br>
room.</p>

<p>As she did so, I perceived that on passing the table, her eyes
fell upon<br>
the paper I had been scribbling over so long, and I thought that
for<br>
an instant an expression of ineffable scorn seemed to pass across
her<br>
features, save which&mdash;and perhaps even in this I was
mistaken&mdash;her manner<br>
was perfectly calm, easy, and indifferent.</p>

<p>Scarce had the carriage rolled from the door, when the
senhora, throwing<br>
herself upon her chair, clapped her hands in childish ecstasy,
while she<br>
fell into a fit of laughing that I thought would never have an
end. "Such<br>
a scene!" cried she; "I would not have lost it for the world;
what<br>
cordiality! what <i>empressement</i> to form acquaintance! I shall
never forget<br>
it, Monsieur le Chevalier; your national customs seem to run
sadly in<br>
extremes. One would have thought you deadly enemies; and poor me,
after a<br>
thousand delightful plans about you both!"</p>

<p>As she ran on thus, scarce able to control her mirth at each
sentence, I<br>
walked the room with impatient strides, now, resolving to hasten
after the<br>
carriage, stop it, explain in a few words how all had happened,
and then<br>
fly from her forever; then the remembrance of her cold, impassive
look<br>
crossed me, and I thought that one bold leap into the Tagus might
be the<br>
shortest and easiest solution to all my miseries. Perfect
abasement,<br>
thorough self-contempt had broken all my courage, and I could
have cried<br>
like a child. What I said, or how I comforted myself after, I
know not; but<br>
my first consciousness came to me as I felt myself running at the
top of my<br>
speed far upon the road towards Lisbon.</p>

<br><br><br><br><p>CHAPTER XI.</p>

<p>THE DINNER.</p>

<p>It may easily be imagined that I had little inclination to
keep my promise<br>
of dining that day with Sir George Dashwood. However, there was
nothing<br>
else for it; the die was cast,&mdash;my prospects as regarded Lucy
were ruined<br>
forever. We were not, we never could be anything to each other;
and as for<br>
me, the sooner I braved my altered fortunes the better; and after
all, why<br>
should I call them altered. She evidently never had cared for me;
and even<br>
supposing that my fervent declaration of attachment had
interested her, the<br>
apparent duplicity and falseness of my late conduct could only
fall the<br>
more heavily upon me.</p>

<p>I endeavored to philosophize myself into calmness and
indifference. One by<br>
one I exhausted every argument for my defence, which, however
ingeniously<br>
put forward, brought no comfort to my own conscience. I pleaded
the<br>
unerring devotion of my heart, the uprightness of my motives, and
when<br>
called on for the proofs,&mdash;alas! except the blue scarf I wore in
memory of<br>
another, and my absurd conduct at the villa, I had none. From the
current<br>
gossip of Lisbon, down to my own disgraceful folly, all, all was
against<br>
me.</p>

<p>Honesty of intention, rectitude of purpose, may be, doubtless
they are,<br>
admirable supports to a rightly constituted mind; but even then
they must<br>
come supported by such claims to probability as make the injured
man feel<br>
he has not lost the sympathy of all his fellows. Now, I had none
of these,<br>
had even my temperament, broken by sickness and harassed by
unlucky<br>
conjectures, permitted my appreciating them.</p>

<p>I endeavored to call my wounded pride to my aid, and thought
over the<br>
glance of haughty disdain she gave me as she passed on to her
carriage; but<br>
even this turned against me, and a humiliating sense of my own
degraded<br>
position sank deeply into my heart. "This impression at least,"
thought I,<br>
"must be effaced. I cannot permit her to believe&mdash;"</p>

<p>"His Excellency is waiting dinner, sir," said a lackey,
introducing a<br>
finely powdered head gently within the door. I looked at my
watch, it was<br>
eight o'clock; so snatching my sabre, and shocked at my delay,
I<br>
hastily followed the servant down-stairs, and thus at once cut
short my<br>
deliberations.</p>

<p>The man must be but little observant or deeply sunk in his own
reveries,<br>
who, arriving half-an-hour too late for dinner, fails to detect
in the<br>
faces of the assembled and expectant guests a very palpable
expression of<br>
discontent and displeasure. It is truly a moment of awkwardness,
and one<br>
in which few are found to manage with success; the blushing,
hesitating,<br>
blundering apology of the absent man, is scarcely better than
the<br>
ill-affected surprise of the more practised offender. The
bashfulness of<br>
the one is as distasteful as the cool impertinence of the other;
both are<br>
so thoroughly out of place, for we are thinking of neither; our
thoughts<br>
are wandering to cold soups and rechauff&eacute;d
p&acirc;t&eacute;s, and we neither care for<br>
nor estimate the cause, but satisfy our spleen by cursing the
offender.</p>

<p>Happily for me I was clad in a triple insensibility to such
feelings,<br>
and with an air of most perfect unconstraint and composure walked
into<br>
a drawing-room where about twenty persons were busily discussing
what<br>
peculiar amiability in my character could compensate for my
present<br>
conduct.</p>

<p>"At last, O'Malley, at last!" said Sir George. "Why, my dear
boy, how very<br>
late you are!"</p>

<p>I muttered something about a long walk,&mdash;distance from Lisbon,
etc.</p>

<p>"Ah! that was it. I was right, you see!" said an old lady in a
spangled<br>
turban, as she whispered something to her friend beside her, who
appeared<br>
excessively shocked at the information conveyed; while a fat,
round-faced<br>
little general, after eying me steadily through his glass,
expressed a<br>
<i>sotto voce</i> wish that I was upon <i>his</i> staff. I felt my cheek
reddening<br>
at the moment, and stared around me like one whose trials were
becoming<br>
downright insufferable, when happily dinner was announced, and
terminated<br>
my embarrassment.</p>

<p>As the party filed past, I perceived that Miss Dashwood was
not among them;<br>
and with a heart relieved for the moment by the circumstance, and
inventing<br>
a hundred conjectures to account for it, I followed with the
aides-de-camp<br>
and the staff to the dinner-room.</p>

<p>The temperament is very Irish, I believe, which renders a man
so elastic<br>
that from the extreme of depression to the very climax of high
spirits,<br>
there is but one spring. To this I myself plead guilty, and thus,
scarcely<br>
was I freed from the embarrassment which a meeting with Lucy
Dashwood must<br>
have caused, when my heart bounded with lightness.</p>

<p>When the ladies withdrew, the events of the campaign became
the subject of<br>
conversation, and upon these, very much to my astonishment, I
found myself<br>
consulted as an authority. The Douro, from some fortunate
circumstance, had<br>
given me a reputation I never dreamed of, and I heard my opinions
quoted<br>
upon topics of which my standing as an officer, and my rank in
the service,<br>
could not imply a very extended observation. Power was absent on
duty; and<br>
happily for my supremacy, the company consisted entirely of
generals in the<br>
commissariat or new arrivals from England, all of whom knew still
less than<br>
myself.</p>

<p>What will not iced champagne and flattery do? Singly, they are
strong<br>
impulses; combined, their power is irresistible. I now heard for
the first<br>
time that our great leader had been elevated to the peerage by
the title of<br>
Lord Wellington, and I sincerely believe&mdash;however now I may smile
at the<br>
confession&mdash;that, at the moment, I felt more elation at the
circumstance<br>
than he did. The glorious sensation of being in any way, no
matter how<br>
remotely, linked with the career of those whose path is a high
one, and<br>
whose destinies are cast for great events, thrilled through me;
and in<br>
all the warmth of my admiration and pride for our great captain,
a secret<br>
pleasure stirred within me as I whispered to myself, "And I, too,
am a<br>
soldier!"</p>

<p>I fear me that very little flattery is sufficient to turn the
head of a<br>
young man of eighteen; and if I yielded to the "pleasant
incense," let my<br>
apology be that I was not used to it; and lastly, let me avow, if
I did get<br>
tipsy, I liked the liquor. And why not? It is the only tipple I
know of<br>
that leaves no headache the next morning to punish you for the
glories of<br>
the past night. It may, like all other strong potations, it is
true, induce<br>
you to make a fool of yourself when under its influence; but like
the<br>
nitrous-oxide gas, its effects are passing, and as the pleasure
is an<br>
ecstasy for the time, and your constitution none the worse when
it is over,<br>
I really see no harm in it.</p>

<p>Then the benefits are manifest; for while he who gives becomes
never the<br>
poorer for his benevolence, the receiver is made rich indeed. It
matters<br>
little that some dear, kind friend is ready with his bitter
draught to<br>
remedy what he is pleased to call its unwholesome sweetness; you
betake<br>
yourself with only the more pleasure to the "blessed elixir,"
whose<br>
fascinations neither the poverty of your pocket, nor the penury
of your<br>
brain, can withstand, and by the magic of whose spell you are
great and<br>
gifted. "<i>Vive la bagatelle!</i>" saith the Frenchman. "Long live
flattery!"<br>
say I, come from what quarter it will,&mdash;the only wealth of the
poor man,<br>
the only reward of the unknown one; the arm that supports us in
failure;<br>
the hand that crowns us in success; the comforter in our
affliction; the<br>
gay companion in our hours of pleasure; the lullaby of the
infant; the<br>
staff of old age; the secret treasure we lock up in our own
hearts, and<br>
which ever grows greater as we count it over. Let me not be told
that the<br>
coin is fictitious, and the gold not genuine; its clink is as
musical to<br>
the ear as though it bore the last impression of the mint, and
I'm not the<br>
man to cast an aspersion upon its value.</p>

<p>This little digression, however seemingly out of place, may
serve to<br>
illustrate what it might be difficult to convey in other
words,&mdash;namely,<br>
that if Charles O'Malley became, in his own estimation, a very
considerable<br>
personage that day at dinner, the fault lay not entirely with
himself, but<br>
with his friends, who told him he was such. In fact, my good
reader, I was<br>
the lion of the party, the man who saved Laborde, who charged
through a<br>
brigade of guns, who performed feats which newspapers quoted,
though he<br>
never heard of them himself. At no time is a man so successful in
society<br>
as when his reputation heralds him; and it needs but little
conversational<br>
eloquence to talk well, if you have but a willing and ready
auditory. Of<br>
mine, I could certainly not complain; and as, drinking deeply, I
poured<br>
forth a whole tide of campaigning recital, I saw the old colonels
of<br>
recruiting districts exchanging looks of wonder and admiration
with<br>
officers of the ordnance; while Sir George himself, evidently
pleased at my<br>
<i>d&eacute;but</i>, went back to an early period of our acquaintance,
and related the<br>
rescue of his daughter in Galway.</p>

<p>In an instant the whole current of my thoughts was changed. My
first<br>
meeting with Lucy, my boyhood's dream of ambition, my plighted
faith,<br>
my thought of our last parting in Dublin, when, in a moment of
excited<br>
madness, I told my tale of love. I remembered her downcast look,
as her<br>
cheek now flushing, now growing pale, she trembled while I spoke.
I thought<br>
of her, as in the crash of battle her image flashed across my
brain, and<br>
made me feel a rush of chivalrous enthusiasm to win her heart by
"doughty<br>
deeds."</p>

<p>I forgot all around and about me. My head reeled, the wine,
the excitement,<br>
my long previous illness, all pressed upon me; and as my temples
throbbed<br>
loudly and painfully, a chaotic rush of discordant, ill-connected
ideas<br>
flitted across my mind. There seemed some stir and confusion in
the room,<br>
but why or wherefore I could not think, nor could I recall my
scattered<br>
senses, till Sir George Dashwood's voice roused me once again
to<br>
consciousness.</p>

<p>"We are going to have some coffee, O'Malley. Miss Dashwood
expects us in<br>
the drawing-room. You have not seen her yet?"</p>

<p>I know not my reply; but he continued:&mdash;</p>

<p>"She has some letters for you, I think."</p>

<p>I muttered something, and suffered him to pass on; no sooner
had he done<br>
so, however, than I turned towards the door, and rushed into the
street.<br>
The cold night air suddenly recalled me to myself, and I stood
for a moment<br>
endeavoring to collect myself; as I did so, a servant stopped,
and saluting<br>
me, presented me with a letter. For a second, a cold chill came
over me; I<br>
knew not what fear beset me. The letter, I at last remembered,
must be that<br>
one alluded to by Sir George, so I took it in silence, and walked
on.</p>

<br><br><br><br><p>CHAPTER XII.</p>

<p>THE LETTER.</p>

<p>As I hurried to my quarters, I made a hundred guesses from
whom the letter<br>
could have come; a kind of presentiment told me that it bore, in
some<br>
measure, upon the present crisis of my life, and I burned with
anxiety to<br>
read it.</p>

<p>No sooner had I reached the light, than all my hopes on this
head vanished;<br>
the envelope bore the well-known name of my old college chum,
Frank Webber,<br>
and none could, at the moment, have more completely dispelled all
chance<br>
of interesting me. I threw it from me with disappointment, and
sat moodily<br>
down to brood over my fate.</p>

<p>At length, however, and almost without knowing it, I drew the
lamp towards<br>
me, and broke the seal. The reader being already acquainted with
my amiable<br>
friend, there is the less indiscretion in communicating the
contents, which<br>
ran thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>    TRINITY COLLEGE, DUBLIN, No. 2,</p>

<p>    October 5, 1810.</p>

<p>    My Dear O'Malley,&mdash;Nothing short of your death and
burial,<br>
    with or without military honors, can possibly excuse your
very<br>
    disgraceful neglect of your old friends here. Nesbitt has
never<br>
    heard of you, neither has Smith. Ottley swears never to have
seen<br>
    your handwriting, save on the back of a protested bill. You
have<br>
    totally forgotten <i>me</i>, and the dean informs me that you have
never<br>
    condescended a single line to him; which latter inquiry on my
part<br>
    nearly cost me a rustication.</p>

<p>    A hundred conjectures to account for your silence&mdash;a new
feature<br>
    in you since you were here&mdash;are afloat. Some assert that
your<br>
    soldiering has turned your head, and that you are above
corresponding<br>
    with civilians. Your friends, however, who know you better
and<br>
    value your worth, think otherwise; and having seen a
paragraph<br>
    about a certain O'Malley being tried by court-martial for
stealing a<br>
    goose, and maltreating the woman that owned it, ascribe your
not<br>
    writing to other motives. Do, in any case, relieve our minds;
say,<br>
    is it yourself, or only a relative that's mentioned?<br>
    Herbert came over from London with a long story about
your<br>
    doing wonderful things,&mdash;capturing cannon and general
officers by<br>
    scores,&mdash;but devil a word of it is extant; and if you have
really<br>
    committed these acts, they have "misused the king's press
damnably,"<br>
    for neither in the "Times" nor the "Post" are you heard
of.<br>
    Answer this point, and say also if you have got promotion;
for what<br>
    precise sign you are algebraically expressed by at this
writing, may<br>
    serve Fitzgerald for a fellowship question. As for us, we are
jogging<br>
    along, <i>semper eadem</i>,&mdash;that is, worse and worse. Dear
Cecil<br>
    Cavendish, our gifted friend, slight of limb and soft of
voice, has<br>
    been rusticated for immersing four bricklayers in that
green<br>
    receptacle of stagnant water and duckweed, yeleped the
"Haha."<br>
    Roper, equally unlucky, has taken to reading for honors, and
obtained<br>
    a medal, I fancy,&mdash;at least his friends shy him, and it must
be<br>
    something of that kind. Belson&mdash;poor Belson (fortunately for
him he<br>
    was born in the nineteenth, not the sixteenth century, or
he'd be most<br>
    likely ornamenting a pile of fagots) ventured upon some
stray<br>
    excursions into the Hebrew verbs,&mdash;the professor himself
never having<br>
    transgressed beyond the declensions, and the consequence is,
he is<br>
    in disgrace among the seniors. And as for me, a heavy charge
hangs<br>
    over my devoted head even while I write. The senior lecturer,
it<br>
    appears, has been for some time instituting some very
singular<br>
    researches into the original state of our goodly college at
its<br>
    founding. Plans and specifications showing its extent and
magnificence<br>
    have been continually before the board for the last month;
and in such<br>
    repute have been a smashed door-sill or an old arch, that
freshmen<br>
    have now abandoned conic sections for crowbars, and instead
of the<br>
    "Principia" have taken up the pickaxe. You know, my dear
fellow,<br>
    with what enthusiasm I enter into any scheme for the
aggrandizement<br>
    of our Alma Mater, so I need not tell you how ardently I<br>
    adventured into the career now opened to me. My time was
completely<br>
    devoted to the matter; neither means nor health did I
spare,<br>
    and in my search for antiquarian lore, I have actually
undermined<br>
    the old wall of the fellows' garden, and am each morning in
expectation<br>
    of hearing that the big bell near the commons-hall has
descended<br>
    from its lofty and most noisy eminence, and is snugly
reposing in<br>
    the mud. Meanwhile accident put me in possession of a
most<br>
    singular and remarkable discovery. Our chambers&mdash;I call
them<br>
    ours for old association sake&mdash;are, you may remember, in the
Old<br>
    Square. Well, I have been fortunate enough, within the very
precincts<br>
    of my own dwelling, to contribute a very wonderful fact to
the<br>
    history of the University; alone, unassisted, unaided, I
labored<br>
    at my discovery. Few can estimate the pleasure I felt, the
fame<br>
    and reputation I anticipated. I drew up a little memoir for
the<br>
    board, most respectfully and civilly worded, having for title
the<br>
    following:&mdash;</p>

<p>    ACCOUNT<br>
    Of a remarkable Subterranean Passage lately discovered in
the<br>
    Old Building of Trinity College, Dublin;<br>
    With Observations upon its Extent, Antiquity, and Probable
Use.<br>
    By F. WEBBER, Senior Freshman.</p>

<p>    My dear O'Malley, I'll not dwell upon the pride I felt in
my new<br>
    character of antiquarian; it is enough to state, that my
very<br>
    remarkable tract was well considered and received, and a
commission<br>
    appointed to investigate the discovery, consisting of the<br>
    vice-provost, the senior lecturer, old Woodhouse, the
sub-dean, and<br>
    a few more.</p>

<p>    On Tuesday last they came accordingly in full academic
costume.<br>
    I, being habited most accurately in the like manner,
conducted<br>
    them with all form into my bed-room, where a large screen
concealed<br>
    from view the entrance to the tunnel alluded to. Assuming a
very<br>
    John Kembleish attitude, I struck this down with one hand,
pointing<br>
    with the other to the wall, as I exclaimed, "There! look<br>
    there!"</p>

<p>    I need only quote Barret's exclamation to enlighten you
upon my<br>
    discovery as, drawing in his breath with a strong effort, he
burst<br>
    out:&mdash;</p>

<p>    "May the Devil admire me, but it's a rat-hole!"</p>

<p>    I fear, Charley, he's right, and what's more, that the
board will<br>
    think so, for this moment a very warm discussion is going on
among<br>
    that amiable and learned body whether I shall any longer
remain an<br>
    ornament to the University. In fact, the terror with which
they<br>
    fled from my chambers, overturning each other in the
passage,<br>
    seemed to imply that they thought me mad, and I do believe
my<br>
    voice, look, and attitude would not have disgraced a blue
cotton<br>
    dressing-gown and a cell in "Swift's." Be this as it may, few
men<br>
    have done more for college than I have. The sun never stood
still<br>
    for Joshua with more resolution than I have rested in my
career of<br>
    freshman; and if I have contributed little to the fame, I
have done<br>
    much for the funds of the University; and when they come to
compute<br>
    the various sums I have paid in, for fines, penalties, and
what<br>
    they call properly "impositions," if they don't place a
portrait of me<br>
    in the examination hall, between Archbishop Ussher and Flood,
then<br>
    do I say there is no gratitude in mankind; not to mention the
impulse<br>
    I have given to the various artisans whose business it is
to<br>
    repair lamps, windows, chimneys, iron railings, and watchmen,
all<br>
    of which I have devoted myself to with an enthusiasm for
political<br>
    economy well known, and registered in the College Street
police-office.</p>

<p>    After all, Charley, I miss you greatly. Your second in a
ballad is<br>
    not to be replaced; besides, Carlisle Bridge has got low;
medical<br>
    students and young attorneys affect minstrelsy, and actually
frequent<br>
    the haunts sacred to our muse.</p>

<p>    Dublin is, upon the whole, I think, worse; though one
scarcely<br>
    ever gets tired laughing at the small celebrities&mdash;</p>

<p>Master Frank gets here indiscreet, so I shall skip.</p>

<p>    And so the Dashwoods are going too; this will make mine
a<br>
    pitiable condition, for I really did begin to feel tender in
that<br>
    quarter. You may have heard that she refused me; this,
however, is not<br>
    correct, though I have little doubt it might have been,&mdash;had
I<br>
    asked her.</p>

<p>    Hammersley has, you know, got his dismissal. I wonder how
the<br>
    poor fellow took it when Power gave him back his letters and
his<br>
    picture. How <i>you</i> are to be treated remains to be seen; in
any<br>
    case, you certainly stand first favorite.</p>

<p>I laid down the letter at this passage, unable to read
farther. Here, then,<br>
was the solution of the whole chaos of mystery; here the full
explanation<br>
of what had puzzled my aching brain for many a night long. These
were the<br>
very letters I had myself delivered into Hammersley's hands; this
the<br>
picture he had trodden to dust beneath his heel the morning of
our meeting.<br>
I now felt the reason of his taunting allusion to my "success,"
his cutting<br>
sarcasm, his intemperate passion. A flood of light poured at once
across<br>
all the dark passages of my history; and Lucy, too,&mdash;dare I think
of her! A<br>
rapid thought shot through my brain. What if she had really cared
for me!<br>
What if for me she had rejected another's love! What if, trusting
to my<br>
faith, my pledged and sworn faith, she had given me her heart!
Oh, the<br>
bitter agony of that thought! To think that all my hopes were
shipwrecked<br>
with the very land in sight.</p>

<p>I sprang to my feet with some sudden impulse, but as I did so
the blood<br>
rushed madly to my face and temples, which beat violently; a
parched and<br>
swollen feeling came about my throat; I endeavored to open my
collar<br>
and undo my stock, but my disabled arm prevented me. I tried to
call<br>
my servant, but my utterance was thick and my words would not
come; a<br>
frightful suspicion crossed me that my reason was tottering. I
made towards<br>
the door; but as I did so, the objects around me became confused
and<br>
mingled, my limbs trembled, and I fell heavily upon the floor. A
pang of<br>
dreadful pain shot through me as I fell; my arm was rebroken.
After this I<br>
knew no more; all the accumulated excitement of the evening bore
down with<br>
one fell swoop upon my brain. Ere day broke, I was delirious.</p>

<p>I have a vague and indistinct remembrance of hurried and
anxious faces<br>
around my bed, of whispered words and sorrowful looks; but my own
thoughts<br>
careered over the bold hills of the far west as I trod them in
my<br>
boyhood, free and high of heart, or recurred to the din and crash
of the<br>
battle-field, with the mad bounding of the war-horse, and the
loud clang of<br>
the trumpet. Perhaps the acute pain of my swollen and suffering
arm gave<br>
the character to my mental aberration; for I have more than once
observed<br>
among the wounded in battle, that even when torn and mangled by
grape<br>
from a howitzer, their ravings have partaken of a high feature
of<br>
enthusiasm,&mdash;shouts of triumph and exclamations of pleasure,
even<br>
songs have I heard, but never once the low muttering of despair
or the<br>
half-stifled cry of sorrow and affliction.</p>

<p>Such were the few gleams of consciousness which visited me;
and even to<br>
such as these I soon became insensible.</p>

<p>Few like to chronicle, fewer still to read, the sad history of
a sick-bed.<br>
Of mine, I know but little. The throbbing pulses of the erring
brain, the<br>
wild fancies of lunacy, take no note of time. There is no past
nor future;<br>
a dreadful present, full of its hurried and confused impressions,
is all<br>
that the mind beholds; and even when some gleams of returning
reason flash<br>
upon the mad confusion of the brain, they come like sunbeams
through a<br>
cloud, dimmed, darkened, and perverted.</p>

<p>It is the restless activity of the mind in fever that
constitutes its<br>
most painful anguish; the fast-flitting thoughts that rush ever
onwards,<br>
crowding sensation on sensation, an endless train of exciting
images<br>
without purpose or repose; or even worse, the straining effort to
pursue<br>
some vague and shadowy conception which evades us ever as we
follow, but<br>
which mingles with all around and about us, haunting us at
midnight as in<br>
the noontime. Of this nature was a vision which came constantly
before<br>
me, till at length, by its very recurrence, it assumed a kind of
real and<br>
palpable existence; and as I watched it, my heart thrilled with
the high<br>
ardor of enthusiasm and delight, or sunk into the dark abyss of
sorrow and<br>
despair. "The dawning of morning, the daylight sinking," brought
no other<br>
image to my aching sight; and of this alone, of all the
impressions of the<br>
period, has my mind retained any consciousness.</p>

<p>Methought I stood within an old and venerable cathedral, where
the dim<br>
yellow light fell with a rich but solemn glow upon the fretted
capitals,<br>
or the grotesque tracings of the oaken carvings, lighting up the
fading<br>
gildings of the stately monuments, and tinting the varied hues of
time-worn<br>
banners. The mellow notes of a deep organ filled the air, and
seemed to<br>
attune the sense to all the awe and reverence of the place, where
the very<br>
footfall, magnified by its many echoes, seemed half a
profanation. I stood<br>
before an altar, beside me a young and lovely girl, whose bright
brown<br>
tresses waved in loose masses upon a neck of snowy whiteness; her
hand,<br>
cold and pale, rested within my own; we knelt together, not in
prayer, but<br>
a feeling of deep reverence stole over my heart, as she repeated
some few<br>
half-uttered words after me; I knew that she was mine. Oh, the
ecstasy of<br>
that moment, as, springing to my feet, I darted forward to press
her to my<br>
heart! When, suddenly, an arm was interposed between us, while a
low but<br>
solemn voice rang in my ears, "Stir not; for thou art false and
traitorous,<br>
thy vow a perjury, and thy heart a lie!" Slowly and silently the
fair form<br>
of my loved Lucy&mdash;for it was her&mdash;receded from my sight. One
look, one last<br>
look of sorrow&mdash;it was scarce reproach&mdash;fell upon me, and I sank
back upon<br>
the cold pavement, broken-hearted and forsaken.</p>

<p>This dream came with daybreak, and with the calm repose of
evening; the<br>
still hours of the waking night brought no other image to my
eyes, and when<br>
its sad influence had spread a gloom and desolation over my
wounded heart,<br>
a secret hope crept over me, that again the bright moment of
happiness<br>
would return, and once more beside that ancient altar I'd kneel
beside my<br>
bride, and call her mine.</p>

<p>For the rest, my memory retains but little; the kind looks
which came<br>
around my bedside brought but a brief pleasure, for in their
affectionate<br>
beaming I could read the gloomy prestige of my fate. The hurried
but<br>
cautious step, the whispered sentences, the averted gaze of those
who<br>
sorrowed for me, sunk far deeper into my heart than my friends
then thought<br>
of. Little do they think, who minister to the sick or dying, how
each<br>
passing word, each flitting glance is noted, and how the pale and
stilly<br>
figure which lies all but lifeless before them counts over the
hours he has<br>
to live by the smiles or tears around him!</p>

<p>Hours, days, weeks rolled over, and still my fate hung in the
balance; and<br>
while in the wild enthusiasm of my erring faculties, I wandered
far in<br>
spirit from my bed of suffering and pain, some well-remembered
voice beside<br>
me would strike upon my ear, bringing me back, as if by magic, to
all the<br>
realities of life, and investing my almost unconscious state with
all the<br>
hopes and fears about me.</p>

<p>One by one, at length, these fancies fled from me, and to the
delirium of<br>
fever succeeded the sad and helpless consciousness of illness,
far, far<br>
more depressing; for as the conviction of sense came back, the
sorrowful<br>
aspect of a dreary future came with it.</p>

<br><br><br><br><p>CHAPTER XIII.</p>

<p>THE VILLA.</p>

<p>The gentle twilight of an autumnal evening, calm, serene, and
mellow, was<br>
falling as I opened my eyes to consciousness of life and being,
and looked<br>
around me. I lay in a large and handsomely-furnished apartment,
in which<br>
the hand of taste was as evident in all the decorations as the
unsparing<br>
employment of wealth; the silk draperies of my bed, the inlaid
tables, the<br>
ormolu ornaments which glittered upon the chimney, were one by
one so many<br>
puzzles to my erring senses, and I opened and shut my eyes again
and again,<br>
and essayed by every means in my power to ascertain if they were
not the<br>
visionary creations of a fevered mind. I stretched out my hands
to feel the<br>
objects; and even while holding the freshly-plucked flowers in my
grasp I<br>
could scarce persuade myself that they were real. A thrill of
pain at this<br>
instant recalled me to other thoughts, and I turned my eyes upon
my wounded<br>
arm, which, swollen and stiffened, lay motionless beside me.
Gradually, my<br>
memory came back, and to my weak faculties some passages of my
former<br>
life were presented, not collectedly it is true, nor in any
order, but<br>
scattered, isolated scenes. While such thoughts flew past, my
ever-rising<br>
question to myself was, "Where am I now?" The vague feeling which
illness<br>
leaves upon the mind, whispered to me of kind looks and soft
voices; and<br>
I had a dreamy consciousness about me of being watched and cared
for, but<br>
wherefore, or by whom, I knew not.</p>

<p>From a partly open door which led into a garden, a mild and
balmy air<br>
fanned my temples and soothed my heated brow; and as the light
curtain<br>
waved to and fro with the breeze, the odor of the rose and the
orange-tree<br>
filled the apartment.</p>

<p>There is something in the feeling of weakness which succeeds
to long<br>
illness of the most delicious and refined enjoyment. The spirit
emerging as<br>
it were from the thraldom of its grosser prison, rises high and
triumphant<br>
above the meaner thoughts and more petty ambitions of daily life.
Purer<br>
feelings, more ennobling hopes succeed; and dreams of our
childhood,<br>
mingling with our promises for the future, make up an ideal
existence<br>
in which the low passions and cares of ordinary life enter not or
are<br>
forgotten. 'Tis then we learn to hold converse with ourselves;
'tis then we<br>
ask how has our manhood performed the promises of its youth, or
have our<br>
ripened prospects borne out the pledges of our boyhood? 'Tis
then, in<br>
the calm justice of our lonely hearts, we learn how our failures
are but<br>
another name for our faults, and that what we looked on as the
vicissitudes<br>
of fortune are but the fruits of our own vices. Alas, how
short-lived are<br>
such intervals! Like the fitful sunshine in the wintry sky, they
throw one<br>
bright and joyous tint over the dark landscape: for a moment the
valley and<br>
the mountain-top are bathed in a ruddy glow; the leafless tree
and the dark<br>
moss seem to feel a touch of spring; but the next instant it is
past; the<br>
lowering clouds and dark shadows intervene, and the cold blast,
the moaning<br>
wind, and the dreary waste are once more before us.</p>

<p>I endeavored to recall the latest events of my career, but in
vain; the<br>
real and the visionary were inextricably mingled, and the scenes
of my<br>
campaigns were blended with hopes and fears and doubts which had
no<br>
existence save in my dreams. My curiosity to know where I was
grew now my<br>
strongest feeling, and I raised myself with one arm to look
around me. In<br>
the room all was still and silent, but nothing seemed to intimate
what I<br>
sought for. As I looked, however, the wind blew back the curtain
which<br>
half-concealed the sash-door, and disclosed to me the figure of a
man<br>
seated at a table; his back was towards me, but his broad
sombrero hat<br>
and brown mantle bespoke his nation; the light blue curl of
smoke<br>
which wreathed gently upwards, and the ample display of
long-necked,<br>
straw-wrapped flasks, also attested that he was enjoying himself
with true<br>
Peninsular gusto, having probably partaken of a long siesta.</p>

<p>It was a perfect picture in its way of the indolent luxury of
the<br>
South,&mdash;the rich and perfumed flowers, half-closing to the night
air, but<br>
sighing forth a perfumed <i>buonas noches</i> as they betook
themselves to rest;<br>
the slender shadows of the tall shrubs, stretching motionless
across the<br>
walks; the very attitude of the figure himself was in keeping as
supported<br>
by easy chairs he lounged at full length, raising his head ever
and anon as<br>
if to watch the wreath of eddying smoke as it rose upwards from
his cigar<br>
and melted away in the distance.</p>

<p>[MR. FREE TURNED SPANIARD.]</p>
<br><br>
<p>"Yes", thought I, as I looked for some time, "such is the very
type of his<br>
nation. Surrounded by every luxury of climate, blessed with all
that earth<br>
can offer of its best and fairest, and yet only using such gifts
as mere<br>
sensual gratifications." Starting with this theme, I wove a whole
story for<br>
the unknown personage whom, in my wandering fancy, I began by
creating<br>
a grandee of Portugal, invested with rank honors, and riches; but
who,<br>
effeminated by the habits and usages of his country, had become
the mere<br>
idle voluptuary, living a life of easy and inglorious indolence.
My further<br>
musings were interrupted at this moment for the individual to
whom I<br>
had been so complimentary in my revery, slowly arose from his
recumbent<br>
position, flung his loose mantle carelessly across his left
shoulder, and<br>
pushing open the sash-door, entered my chamber. Directing his
steps to a<br>
large mirror, he stood for some minutes contemplating himself
with what,<br>
from his attitude, I judged to be no small satisfaction. Though
his back<br>
was still towards me, and the dim twilight of the room too
uncertain to see<br>
much, yet I could perceive that he was evidently admiring himself
in the<br>
glass. Of this fact I had soon the most complete proof; for as I
looked,<br>
he slowly raised his broad-leafed Spanish hat with an air of most
imposing<br>
pretension, and bowed reverently to himself.</p>

<p>"<i>Come sta vostra senoria?</i>" said he.</p>

<p>The whole gesture and style of this proceeding struck me as so
ridiculous,<br>
that in spite of all my efforts I could scarcely repress a laugh.
He turned<br>
quickly round and approached the bed. The deep shadow of the
sombrero<br>
darkened the upper part of his features, but I could distinguish
a pair of<br>
fierce-looking mustaches beneath, which curled upwards towards
his eyes,<br>
while a stiff point beard stuck straight from his chin. Fearing
lest my<br>
rude interruption had been overheard, I was framing some polite
speech in<br>
Portuguese, when he opened the dialogue by asking in that
language how I<br>
did.</p>

<p>I replied, and was about to ask some questions relative to
where, and<br>
under whose protection I then was, when my grave-looking friend,
giving a<br>
pirouette upon one leg, sent his hat flying into the air, and
cried out in<br>
a voice that not even my memory could fail to recognize,&mdash;</p>

<p>"By the rock of Cashel he's cured!&mdash;he's cured!&mdash;the fever's
over! Oh,<br>
Master Charles, dear! oh, Master, darling, and you ain't mad,
after all?"</p>

<p>"Mad! no, faith! but I shrewdly suspect you must be."</p>

<p>"Oh, devil a taste! But spake to me, honey; spake to me,
acushla!"</p>

<p>"Where am I? Whose house is this? What do you mean by that
disguise, that<br>
beard&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Whisht, I'll tell you all, av you have patience? But are you
cured? Tell<br>
me that first. Sure they was going to cut the arm off you, till
you got out<br>
of bed, and with your pistols, sent them flying, one out of the
window and<br>
the other down-stairs; and I bate the little chap with the saw
myself till<br>
he couldn't know himself in the glass."</p>

<p>While Mike ran on at this rate, I never took my eyes from him,
and it was<br>
all my poor faculties were equal to, to convince myself that the
whole<br>
scene was not some vision of a wandering intellect. Gradually,
however, the<br>
well-known features recalled me to myself, and as my doubts gave
way at<br>
length, I laughed long and heartily at the masquerade absurdity
of his<br>
appearance.</p>

<p>Mike, meanwhile, whose face expressed no small mistrust at the
sincerity of<br>
my mirth, having uncloaked himself, proceeded to lay aside his
beard and<br>
mustaches, saying, as he did so,&mdash;</p>

<p>"There now, darling; there now, Master, dear,&mdash;don't be
grinning that<br>
way,&mdash;I'll not be a Portigee any more, av you'll be quiet and
listen to<br>
reason."</p>

<p>"But, Mike, where am I? Answer me that one question."</p>

<p>"You're at home, dear; where else would you be?"</p>

<p>"At home?" said I, with a start, as my eye ranged over the
various articles<br>
of luxury and elegance around, so unlike the more simple and
unpretending<br>
features of my uncle's house,&mdash;"at home?"</p>

<p>"Ay, just so; sure, isn't it the same thing. It's ould Don
Emanuel that<br>
owns it; and won't it be your own when you're married to that
lovely<br>
crayture herself?"</p>

<p>I started up, and placing my hand upon my throbbing temples,
asked myself<br>
if I were really awake, or if some flight of fancy had not
carried me away<br>
beyond the bounds of reason and sense. "Go on, go on!" said I, at
length,<br>
in a hollow voice, anxious to gather from his words something
like a clew<br>
to this mystery. "How did this happen?"</p>

<p>"Av ye mean how you came here, faith, it was just this way.
After you got<br>
the fever, and beat the doctors, devil a one would go near you
but myself<br>
and the major."</p>

<p>"The major,&mdash;Major Monsoon?"</p>

<p>"No, Major Power himself. Well, he told your friends up here
how it was<br>
going very hard with you, and that you were like to die; and the
same<br>
evening they sent down a beautiful litter, as like a hearse as
two peas,<br>
for you, and brought you up here in state,&mdash;devil a thing was
wanting but<br>
a few people to raise the cry to make it as fine a funeral as
ever I seen.<br>
And sure, I set up a whillilew myself in the Black Horse Square,
and the<br>
devils only laughed at me.</p>

<p>"Well, you see they put you into a beautiful, elegant bed, and
the young<br>
lady herself sat down beside you, betune times fanning you with a
big<br>
fan, and then drying her eyes, for she was weeping like a
waterfall. 'Don<br>
Miguel,' says she to me,&mdash;for ye see, I put your cloak on by
mistake when I<br>
was leaving the quarters,&mdash;'Don Miguel, questa hidalgo &eacute;
vostro amigo?'</p>

<p>"'My most particular friend,' says I; 'God spare him many
years to be so.'</p>

<p>"'Then take up your quarters here,' says she, 'and don't leave
him; we'll<br>
do everything in our power to make you comfortable.'</p>

<p>"'I'm not particular,' says I; 'the run of the house&mdash;'</p>

<p>"Then this is the Villa Nuova?" said I, with a faint sigh.</p>

<p>"The same," replied Mike; "and a sweet place it is for eating
and<br>
drinking,&mdash;for wine in buckets full, av ye axed for it, for
dancing and<br>
singing every evening, with as pretty craytures as ever I set
eyes upon.<br>
Upon my conscience, it's as good as Galway; and good manners it
is they<br>
have. What's more, none of your liberties or familiarities with
strangers;<br>
but it's Don Miguel, devil a less. 'Don Miguel, av it's plazing
to you to<br>
take a drop of Xeres before your meat?' or, 'Would you have a
shaugh of a<br>
pipe or cigar when you're done?' That's the way of it."</p>

<p>"And Sir George Dashwood," said I, "has he been here? Has he
inquired for<br>
me?"</p>

<p>"Every day either himself or one of the staff comes galloping
up at<br>
luncheon time to ask after you; and then they have a bit of
tender<br>
discourse with the senhora herself. Oh, devil a bit need ye fear
them,<br>
she's true blue; and it isn't the major's fault,&mdash;upon my
conscience it<br>
isn't,&mdash;for he does be coming the blarney over her in beautiful
style."</p>

<p>"Does Miss Dashwood ever visit here?" said I, with a voice
faltering and<br>
uncertain enough to have awakened suspicion in a more practised
observer.</p>

<p>"Never once; and that's what I call unnatural behavior, after
you saving<br>
her life; and if she wasn't&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Be silent, I say."</p>

<p>"Well, well, there, I won't say any more; and sure it's time
for me to be<br>
putting on my beard again. I'm going to the Casino with Catrina,
and sure<br>
it's with real ladies I might be going av it wasn't for Major
Power, that<br>
told them I wasn't a officer; but it's all right again. I gave
them a great<br>
history of the Frees from the time of Cuilla na Toole, that was
one of the<br>
family and a cousin of Moses, I believe; and they behave well to
one that<br>
comes from an ould stock."</p>

<p>"Don Miguel! Don Miguel!" said a voice from the garden.</p>

<p>"I'm coming, my angel! I'm coming, my turtle-dove!" said Mike,
arranging<br>
his mustaches and beard with amazing dexterity. "Ah, but it would
do your<br>
heart good av you could take a peep at us about twelve o'clock,
dancing<br>
'Dirty James' for a bolero, and just see Miss Catrina, the lady's
maid,<br>
doing 'cover the buckle' as neat as Nature. There now, there's
the lemonade<br>
near your hand, and I'll leave you the lamp, and you may go
asleep as soon<br>
as you please, for Miss Inez won't come in to-night to play the
guitar, for<br>
the doctor said it might do you harm now."</p>

<p>So saying, and before I could summon presence of mind to ask
another<br>
question, Don Miguel wrapped himself in the broad folds of his
Spanish<br>
cloak, and strode from the room with the air of an hidalgo.</p>

<p>I slept but little that night; the full tide of memory,
rushing in upon me,<br>
brought back the hour of my return to Lisbon and the wreck of all
my hopes,<br>
which from the narrative of my servant I now perceived to be
complete. I<br>
dare not venture upon recording how many plans suggested
themselves to my<br>
troubled spirit, and were in turn rejected. To meet Lucy
Dashwood; to make<br>
a full and candid declaration; to acknowledge that flirtation
alone with<br>
Donna Inez (a mere passing, boyish flirtation) had given the
coloring to<br>
my innocent passion, and that in heart and soul I was hers, and
hers<br>
only,&mdash;this was my first resolve; but alas! if I had not courage
to sustain<br>
a common interview, to meet her in the careless crowd of a
drawing-room,<br>
what could I do under circumstances like these? Besides, the
matter would<br>
be cut very short by her coolly declaring that she had neither
right nor<br>
inclination to listen to such a declaration. The recollection of
her look<br>
as she passed me to her carriage came flashing across my brain
and decided<br>
this point. No, no! I'll not encounter that; however appearances
for the<br>
moment had been against me, she should not have treated me thus
coldly and<br>
disdainfully. It was quite clear she had never cared for
me,&mdash;wounded pride<br>
had been her only feeling; and so as I reasoned I ended by
satisfying<br>
myself that in that quarter all was at end forever.</p>

<p>Now then for dilemma number two, I thought. The senhora, my
first impulse<br>
was one of anything but gratitude to her by whose kind, tender
care my<br>
hours of pain and suffering had been soothed and alleviated. But
for her,<br>
I should have been spared all my present embarrassment, all my
shipwrecked<br>
fortunes; but for her I should now be the aide-de-camp residing
in Sir<br>
George Dashwood's own house, meeting with Lucy every hour of the
day,<br>
dining beside her, riding out with her, pressing my suit by every
means and<br>
with every advantage of my position; but for her and her dark
eyes&mdash;and,<br>
by-the-bye, what eyes they are! how full of brilliancy, yet how
teeming<br>
with an expression of soft and melting sweetness; and her mouth,
too,<br>
how perfectly chiselled those full lips,&mdash;how different from the
cold,<br>
unbending firmness of Miss Dashwood's! Not but I have seen Lucy
smile too,<br>
and what a sweet smile! How it lighted up her fair cheek, and
made her blue<br>
eyes darken and deepen till they looked like heaven's own vault.
Yes, there<br>
is more poetry in a blue eye. But still Inez is a very lovely
girl, and<br>
her foot never was surpassed. She is a coquette, too, about that
foot and<br>
ankle,&mdash;I rather like a woman to be so. What a sensation she
would make in<br>
England; how she would be the rage! And then I thought of home
and Galway,<br>
and the astonishment of some, the admiration of others, as I
presented her<br>
as my wife,&mdash;the congratulations of my friends, the wonder of the
men, the<br>
tempered envy of the women. Methought I saw my uncle, as he
pressed her in<br>
his arms, say, "Yes, Charley, this is a prize worth campaigning
for."</p>

<p>The stray sounds of a guitar which came from the garden broke
in upon my<br>
musings at this moment. It seemed as if a finger was straying
heedlessly<br>
across the strings. I started up, and to my surprise perceived it
was Inez.<br>
Before I had time to collect myself, a gentle tap at the window
aroused me;<br>
it opened softly, while from an unseen hand a bouquet of fresh
flowers was<br>
thrown upon my bed. Before I could collect myself to speak, the
sash closed<br>
again and I was alone.</p>

<br><br><br><br><p>CHAPTER XIV.</p>

<p>THE VISIT.</p>

<p>Mike's performances at the masquerade had doubtless been of
the most<br>
distinguished character, and demanded a compensating period of
repose, for<br>
he did not make his appearance the entire morning. Towards noon,
however,<br>
the door from the garden gently opened, and I heard a step upon
the stone<br>
terrace, and something which sounded to my ears like the clank of
a sabre.<br>
I lifted my head, and saw Fred Power beside me.</p>

<p>I shall spare my readers the recital of my friend, which,
however, more<br>
full and explanatory of past events, contained in reality little
more than<br>
Mickey Free had already told me. In fine, he informed me that our
army, by<br>
a succession of retreating movements, had deserted the northern
provinces,<br>
and now occupied the intrenched lines of Torres Vedras. That
Massena, with<br>
a powerful force, was still in march, reinforcements daily
pouring in<br>
upon him, and every expectation pointing to the probability that
he would<br>
attempt to storm our position.</p>

<p>"The wise-heads," remarked Power, "talk of our speedy
embarkation, the<br>
sanguine and the hot-brained rave of a great victory and the
retreat of<br>
Massena; but I was up at headquarters last week with despatches,
and saw<br>
Lord Wellington myself."</p>

<p>"Well, what did you make out? Did he drop any hint of his own
views?"</p>

<p>"Faith, I can't say he did. He asked me some questions about
the troops<br>
just landed; he spoke a little of the commissary department,
damned the<br>
blankets, said that green forage was bad food for the artillery
horses,<br>
sent me an English paper to read about the O. P. riots, and said
the<br>
harriers would throw off about six o'clock, and that he hoped to
see me at<br>
dinner."</p>

<p>I could not restrain a laugh at Power's catalogue of his
lordship's topics.<br>
"So," said I, "he at least does not take any gloomy views of our
present<br>
situation."</p>

<p>"Who can tell what he thinks? He's ready to fight if fighting
will do<br>
anything, and to retreat, if that be better. But that he'll sleep
an hour<br>
less, or drink a glass of claret more&mdash;come what will of it&mdash;I'll
believe<br>
from no man living.</p>

<p>"We've lost one gallant thing in any case, Charley," resumed
Power. "Busaco<br>
was, I'm told, a glorious day, and our people were in the heat of
it. So<br>
that, if we do leave the Peninsula now, that will be a confounded
chagrin.<br>
Not for you, my poor fellow, for you could not stir; but I was so
cursed<br>
foolish to take the staff appointment,&mdash;thus one folly ever
entails<br>
another."</p>

<p>There was a tone of bitterness in which these words were
uttered that left<br>
no doubt upon my mind some <i>arri&egrave;re pens&eacute;e</i>
remained lurking behind them.<br>
My eyes met his; he bit his lip, and coloring deeply, rose from
the chair,<br>
and walked towards the window.</p>

<p>The chance allusion of my man Mike flashed upon me at the
moment, and I<br>
dared not trust myself to break silence. I now thought I could
trace in my<br>
friend's manner less of that gay and careless buoyancy which ever
marked<br>
him. There was a tone, it seemed, of more grave and sombre
character, and<br>
even when he jested, the smile his features bore was not his
usual frank<br>
and happy one, and speedily gave way to an expression I had never
before<br>
remarked. Our silence which had now lasted for some minutes was
becoming<br>
embarrassing; that strange consciousness that, to a certain
extent, we were<br>
reading each other's thoughts, made us both cautious of breaking
it; and<br>
when at length, turning abruptly round, he asked, "When I hoped
to be up<br>
and about again?" I felt my heart relieved from I knew not well
what load<br>
of doubt and difficulty that oppressed it. We chatted on for some
little<br>
time longer, the news of Lisbon, and the daily gossip finishing
our topics.</p>

<p>"Plenty of gayety, Charley, dinners and balls to no end! so
get well, my<br>
boy, and make the most of it."</p>

<p>"Yes," I replied, "I'll do my best; but be assured the first
use I'll make<br>
of health will be to join the regiment. I am heartily ashamed of
myself for<br>
all I have lost already,&mdash;though not altogether my fault."</p>

<p>"And will you really join at once?" said Power, with a look of
eager<br>
anxiety I could not possibly account for.</p>

<p>"Of course I will; what have I, what can I have to detain me
here?"</p>

<p>What reply he was about to make at this moment I know not, but
the door<br>
opened, and Mike announced Sir George Dashwood.</p>

<p>"Gently, my worthy man, not so loud, if you please?" said the
mild voice of<br>
the general, as he stepped noiselessly across the room, evidently
shocked<br>
at the indiscreet tone of my follower. "Ah, Power, you here! and
our poor<br>
friend, how is he?"</p>

<p>"Able to answer for himself at last, Sir George," said I,
grasping his<br>
proffered hand.</p>

<p>"My poor lad! you've had a long bout of it; but you've saved
your arm, and<br>
that's well worth the lost time. Well, I've come to bring you
good news;<br>
there's been a very sharp cavalry affair, and our fellows have
been the<br>
conquerors."</p>

<p>"There again, Power,&mdash;listen to that! We are losing
everything!"</p>

<p>"Not so, not so, my boy," said Sir George, smiling blandly,
but archly.<br>
"There are conquests to be won here, as well as there; and in
your present<br>
state, I rather think you better fitted for such as these."</p>

<p>Power's brow grew clouded; he essayed a smile, but it failed,
and he rose<br>
and hurried towards the window.</p>

<p>As for me, my confusion must have led to a very erroneous
impression of my<br>
real feelings, and I perceived Sir George anxious to turn the
channel of<br>
the conversation.</p>

<p>"You see but little of your host, O'Malley," he resumed; "he
is ever from<br>
home; but I believe nothing could be kinder than his arrangements
for you.<br>
You are aware that he kidnapped you from us? I had sent Forbes
over to<br>
bring you to us; your room was prepared, everything in readiness,
when he<br>
met your man Mike, setting forth upon a mule, who told him you
had just<br>
taken your departure for the villa. We both had our claim upon
you and, I<br>
believe, pretty much on the same score. By-the-bye, you have not
seen Lucy<br>
since your arrival. I never knew it till yesterday, when I asked
if she did<br>
not find you altered."</p>

<p>I blundered out some absurd reply, blushed, corrected myself,
and got<br>
confused. Sir George attributing this, doubtless, to my weak
state, rose<br>
soon after, and taking Power along with him, remarked as he left
the<br>
room,&mdash;</p>

<p>"We are too much for him yet, I see that; so we'll leave him
quiet some<br>
time longer."</p>

<p>Thanking him in my heart for his true appreciation of my
state, I sank back<br>
upon my pillow to think over all I had heard and seen.</p>

<p>"Well, Mister Charles," said Mike as he came forward with a
smile, "I<br>
suppose you heard the news? The Fourteenth bate the French down
at Merca<br>
there, and took seventy prisoners; but sure it's little good
it'll do,<br>
after all."</p>

<p>"And why not, Mike?"</p>

<p>"Musha! isn't Boney coming himself? He's bringing all the
Roossians down<br>
with him, and going to destroy us entirely."</p>

<p>"Not at all, man; you mistake. He's nothing to do with Russia,
and has<br>
quite enough on his hands at this moment."</p>

<p>"God grant it was truth you were talking! But, you see, I read
it myself in<br>
the papers (or Sergeant Haggarty did, which is the same thing)
that he's<br>
coming with the Cusacks."</p>

<p>"With who?&mdash;with what?"</p>

<p>"With the Cusacks."</p>

<p>"What the devil do you mean? Who are they?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Tower of Ivory! did you never hear of the Cusacks, with
the red beards<br>
and the red breeches and long poles with pike-heads on them, that
does all<br>
the devilment on horseback,&mdash;spiking and spitting the people like
larks?"</p>

<p>"The Cossacks, is it, you mean? The Cossacks?"</p>

<p>"Ay, just so, the Cusacks. They're from Clare Island, and
thereabouts; and<br>
there's more of them in Meath. They're my mother's people, and
was always<br>
real devils for fighting."</p>

<p>I burst out into an immoderate fit of laughing at Mike's
etymology, which<br>
thus converted Hetman Platoff into a Galway man.</p>

<p>"Oh, murder! isn't it cruel to hear you laugh that way! There
now, alanna!<br>
be asy, and I'll tell you more news. We've the house to ourselves
to-day.<br>
The ould gentleman's down at Behlem, and the daughter's in
Lisbon, making<br>
great preparations for a grand ball they're to give when you are
quite<br>
well."</p>

<p>"I hope I shall be with the army in a few days, Mike; and
certainly, if I'm<br>
able to move about, I'll not remain longer in Lisbon."</p>

<p>"Arrah, don't say so, now! When was you ever so comfortable?
Upon my<br>
conscience, it's more like Paradise than anything else. If ye see
the<br>
dinner we sit down to every day; and as for drink,&mdash;if it wasn't
that I<br>
sleep on a ground-floor, I'd seldom see a blanket!"</p>

<p>"Well, certainly, Mike, I agree with you, these are hard
things to tear<br>
ourselves away from."</p>

<p>"Aren't they now, sir? And then Miss Catherine, I'm taching
her Irish!"</p>

<p>"Teaching her Irish! for Heaven's sake, what use can she make
of Irish?"</p>

<p>"Ah, the crayture, she doesn't know better; and as she was
always bothering<br>
me to learn her English, I promised one day to do it; but ye see,
somehow,<br>
I never was very proficient in strange tongues; so I thought to
myself<br>
Irish will do as well. So, you perceive, we're taking a course of
Irish<br>
literature, as Mr. Lynch says in Athlone; and, upon my
conscience, she's an<br>
apt scholar."</p>

<p>"'Good-morning to you, Katey,' says Mr. Power to her the other
day, as he<br>
passed through the hall. 'Good-morning, my dear; I hear you speak
English<br>
perfectly now?'</p>

<p>"'<i>Honia mon diaoul</i>,' says she, making a curtsey.</p>

<p>"Be the powers, I thought he'd die with the laughing.</p>

<p>"'Well, my dear, I hope you don't mean it,&mdash;do you know what
you're<br>
saying?'</p>

<p>"'Honor bright, Major!' says I,&mdash;'honor bright!' and I gave
him a wink at<br>
the same time.</p>

<p>"'Oh, that's it!' said he, 'is it!' and so he went off holding
his hands to<br>
his sides with the bare laughing; and your honor knows it wasn't
a blessing<br>
she wished him, for all that."</p>

<br><br><br><br><p>CHAPTER XV.</p>

<p>THE CONFESSION.</p>

<p>"What a strange position this of mine!" thought I, a few
mornings after<br>
the events detailed in the last chapter. "How very fascinating in
some<br>
respects, how full of all the charm of romance, and how
confoundly<br>
difficult to see one's way through!"</p>

<p>To understand my cogitation right, <i>figurez-vous</i>, my dear
reader, a large<br>
and splendidly furnished drawing-room, from one end of which an
orangery<br>
in full blossom opens; from the other is seen a delicious little
boudoir,<br>
where books, bronzes, pictures and statues, in all the artistique
disorder<br>
of a lady's sanctum, are bathed in a deep purple light from a
stained glass<br>
window of the seventeenth century.</p>

<p>On a small table beside the wood fire, whose mellow light is
flirting with<br>
the sunbeams upon the carpet, stands an antique silver
breakfast-service,<br>
which none but the hand of Benvenuto could have chiselled; beside
it sits<br>
a girl, young and beautiful; her dark eyes, beaming beneath their
long<br>
lashes, are fixed with an expression of watchful interest upon a
pale and<br>
sickly youth, who, lounging upon a sofa opposite, is carelessly
turning<br>
over the leaves of a new journal, or gazing steadfastly on the
fretted<br>
gothic of the ceiling, while his thoughts are travelling many a
mile away.<br>
The lady being the Senhora Inez; the nonchalant invalid, your
unworthy<br>
acquaintance, Charles O'Malley.</p>

<p>What a very strange position to be sure.</p>

<p>"Then you are not equal to this ball to-night?" said she,
after a pause of<br>
some minutes.</p>

<p>I turned as she spoke; her words had struck audibly upon my
ear, but, lost<br>
in my revery, I could but repeat my own fixed thought,&mdash;how
strange to be<br>
so situated!</p>

<p>"You are really very tiresome, Signor; I assure you, you are.
I have<br>
been giving you a most elegant description of the Casino
<i>f&ecirc;te</i>, and the<br>
beautiful costume of our Lisbon belles, but I can get nothing
from you but<br>
this muttered something, which may be very shocking for aught I
know. I'm<br>
sure your friend, Major Power, would be much more attentive to
me; that<br>
is," added she, archly, "if Miss Dashwood were not present."</p>

<p>"What! why! You don't mean that there is anything there&mdash;that
Tower is<br>
paying attention to&mdash;"</p>

<p>"<i>Madre divina</i>, how that seems to interest you, and how red
you are! If it<br>
were not that you never met her before, and that your
acquaintance did not<br>
seem to make rapid progress, then I should say you are in love
with her<br>
yourself."</p>

<p>I had to laugh at this, but felt my face flushing more. "And
so," said I,<br>
affecting a careless and indifferent tone, "the gay Fred Power is
smitten<br>
at last!"</p>

<p>"Was it so very difficult a thing to accomplish?" said she,
slyly.</p>

<p>"He seems to say so, at least. And the lady, how does she
appear to receive<br>
his attentions?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I should say with evident pleasure and satisfaction, as
all girls do<br>
the advances of men they don't care for, nor intend to care
for."</p>

<p>"Indeed," said I, slowly, "indeed, Senhora?" looking into her
eyes as I<br>
spoke, as if to read if the lesson were destined for my
benefit.</p>

<p>"There, don't stare so!&mdash;every one knows that."</p>

<p>"So you don't think, then, that Lucy,&mdash;I mean Miss
Dashwood&mdash;Why are you<br>
laughing so?"</p>

<p>"How can I help it; your calling her Lucy is so good, I wish
she heard it;<br>
she's the very proudest girl I ever knew."</p>

<p>"But to come back; you really think she does not care for
him?"</p>

<p>"Not more than for you; and I may be pardoned for the simile,
having seen<br>
your meeting. But let me give you the news of our own
<i>f&ecirc;te</i>. Saturday is<br>
the day fixed; and you must be quite well,&mdash;I insist upon it.
Miss Dashwood<br>
has promised to come,&mdash;no small concession; for after all she has
never<br>
once been here since the day you frightened her. I can't help
laughing at<br>
my blunder,&mdash;the two people I had promised myself should fall
desperately<br>
in love with each other, and who will scarcely meet."</p>

<p>"But I trusted," said I, pettishly, "that you were not
disposed to resign<br>
your own interest in me?"</p>

<p>"Neither was I," said she, with an easy smile, "except that I
have so many<br>
admirers. I might even spare to my friends; though after all I
should be<br>
sorry to lose you, I like you."</p>

<p>"Yes," said I half bitterly, "as girls do those they never
intend to care<br>
for; is it not so?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps, yes, and perhaps&mdash;But is it going to rain? How
provoking! and I<br>
have ordered my horse. Well, Signor Carlos, I leave you to your
delightful<br>
newspaper, and all the magnificent descriptions of battles and
sieges and<br>
skirmishes of which you seem doomed to pine without ceasing.
There, don't<br>
kiss my hand twice; that's not right."</p>

<p>"Well, let me begin again&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I shall not breakfast with you any more. But tell me, am I to
order a<br>
costume for you in Lisbon; or will you arrange all that yourself?
You must<br>
come to the <i>f&ecirc;te</i>, you know."</p>

<p>"If you would be so very kind."</p>

<p>"I will, then, be so very kind; and once more, <i>adios</i>." So
saying, and<br>
with a slight motion of her hand, she smiled a good-by, and left
me.</p>

<p>"What a lovely girl!" thought I, as I rose and walked to the
window,<br>
muttering to myself Othello's line, and&mdash;</p>

<p>    "When I love thee not, chaos is come again."</p>

<p>In fact, it was the perfect expression of my feeling; the only
solution<br>
to all the difficulties surrounding me, being to fall
desperately,<br>
irretrievably in love with the fair senhora, which, all things
considered,<br>
was not a very desperate resource for a gentleman in trouble. As
I thought<br>
over the hopelessness of one attachment, I turned calmly to
consider all<br>
the favorable points of the other. She was truly beautiful,
attractive in<br>
every sense; her manner most fascinating, and her disposition, so
far as<br>
I could pronounce, perfectly amiable. I felt already something
more than<br>
interest about her; how very easy would be the transition to a
stronger<br>
feeling! There was an <i>&eacute;clat</i>, too, about being her
accepted lover that had<br>
its charm. She was the belle <i>par excellence</i> of Lisbon; and then
a sense<br>
of pique crossed my mind as I reflected what would Lucy say of
him whom<br>
she had slighted and insulted, when he became the husband of the
beautiful<br>
millionnaire Senhora Inez?</p>

<p>As my meditations had reached thus far, the door opened
stealthily, and<br>
Catherine appeared, her finger upon her lips, and her gesture
indicating<br>
caution. She carried on her arm a mass of drapery covered by a
large<br>
mantle, which throwing off as she entered, she displayed before
me a rich<br>
blue domino with silver embroidery. It was large and loose in its
folds, so<br>
as thoroughly to conceal the figure of any wearer. This she held
up before<br>
me for an instant without speaking; when at length, seeing my
curiosity<br>
fully excited, she said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"This is the senhora's domino. I should be ruined if she knew
I showed it;<br>
but I promised&mdash;that is, I told&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, I understand," relieving her embarrassment about
the source of<br>
her civilities; "go on."</p>

<p>"Well, there are several others like it, but with this small
difference,<br>
instead of a carnation, which all the others have embroidered
upon the<br>
cuff, I have made it a rose,&mdash;you perceive? La Senhora knows
nothing of<br>
this,&mdash;none save yourself knows it. I'm sure I may trust you with
the<br>
secret."</p>

<p>"Fear not in the least, Catherine; you have rendered me a
great service.<br>
Let me look at it once more; ah, there's no difficulty in
detecting it. And<br>
you are certain she is unaware of it?"</p>

<p>"Perfectly so; she has several other costumes, but in this one
I know she<br>
intends some surprise, so be upon your guard."</p>

<p>With these words, carefully once more concealing the rich
dress beneath the<br>
mantle, she withdrew; while I strolled forth to wonder what
mystery might<br>
lie beneath this scheme, and speculate how far I myself was
included in the<br>
plot she spoke of.</p>

<p>For the few days which succeeded, I passed my time much alone.
The senhora<br>
was but seldom at home; and I remarked that Power rarely came to
see me. A<br>
strange feeling of half-coolness had latterly grown between us,
and instead<br>
of the open confidence we formerly indulged in when together, we
appeared<br>
now rather to chat over things of mere every-day interest than of
our own<br>
immediate plans and prospects. There was a kind of
pre-occupation, too, in<br>
his manner that struck me; his mind seemed ever straying from the
topics he<br>
talked of to something remote, and altogether, he was no longer
the frank<br>
and reckless dragoon I had ever known him. What could be the
meaning of<br>
this change? Had he found out by any accident that I was to blame
in my<br>
conduct towards Lucy; had any erroneous impression of my
interview with her<br>
reached his ears? This was most improbable; besides, there was
nothing in<br>
that to draw down his censure or condemnation, however
represented; and was<br>
it that he was himself in love with her, that, devoted heart and
soul to<br>
Lucy, he regarded me as a successful rival, preferred before him!
Oh, how<br>
could I have so long blinded myself to the fact! This was the
true solution<br>
of the whole difficulty. I had more than once suspected this to
be so; now<br>
all the circumstances of proof poured in upon me. I called to
mind his<br>
agitated manner the night of my arrival in Lisbon, his thousand
questions<br>
concerning the reasons of my furlough; and then, lately, the look
of<br>
unfeigned pleasure with which he heard me resolve to join my
regiment the<br>
moment I was sufficiently recovered. I remembered also how
assiduously he<br>
pressed his intimacy with the senhora, Lucy's dearest friend
here; his<br>
continual visits at the villa; those long walks in the garden,
where his<br>
very look betokened some confidential mission of the heart. Yes,
there was<br>
no doubt of it, he loved Lucy Dashwood! Alas, there seemed to be
no end to<br>
the complication of my misfortunes; one by one I appeared fated
to lose<br>
whatever had a hold upon my affections, and to stand alone,
unloved and<br>
uncared for in the world. My thoughts turned towards the senhora,
but<br>
I could not deceive myself into any hope there. My own feelings
were<br>
untouched, and hers I felt to be equally so. Young as I was,
there was no<br>
mistaking the easy smile of coquetry, the merry laugh of
flattered vanity,<br>
for a deeper and holier feeling. And then I did not wish it
otherwise. One<br>
only had taught me to feel how ennobling, how elevating in all
its impulses<br>
can be a deep-rooted passion for a young and beautiful girl! From
her<br>
eyes alone had I caught the inspiration that made me pant for
glory and<br>
distinction. I could not transfer the allegiance of my heart,
since it had<br>
taught that very heart to beat high and proudly. Lucy, lost to me
forever<br>
as she must be, was still more than any other woman ever could
be; all the<br>
past clung to her memory, all the prestige of the future must
point to it<br>
also.</p>

<p>And Power, why had he not trusted, why had he not confided in
me? Was this<br>
like my old and tried friend? Alas! I was forgetting that in his
eye I was<br>
the favored rival, and not the despised, rejected suitor.</p>

<p>"It is past now," thought I, as I rose and walked into the
garden; "the<br>
dream that made life a fairy tale is dispelled; the cold reality
of the<br>
world is before me, and my path lies a lonely and solitary one."
My first<br>
resolution was to see Power, and relieve his mind of any
uneasiness as<br>
regarded my pretentions; they existed no longer. As for me, I was
no<br>
obstacle to his happiness; it was, then, but fair and honorable
that I<br>
should tell him so; this done, I should leave Lisbon at once. The
cavalry<br>
had for the most part been ordered to the rear; still there was
always<br>
something going forward at the outposts.</p>

<p>The idea of active service, the excitement of a campaigning
life, cheered<br>
me, and I advanced along the dark alley of the garden with a
lighter and a<br>
freer heart. My resolves were not destined to meet delay; as I
turned the<br>
angle of a walk, Power was before me. He was leaning against a
tree, his<br>
hands crossed upon his bosom, his head bowed forward, and his
whole air and<br>
attitude betokening deep reflection.</p>

<p>He started as I came up, and seemed almost to change
color.</p>

<p>"Well, Charley," said he, after a moment's pause, "you look
better this<br>
morning. How goes the arm?"</p>

<p>"The arm is ready for service again, and its owner most
anxious for it. Do<br>
you know, Fred, I'm thoroughly weary of this life."</p>

<p>"They're little better, however, at the lines. The French are
in position,<br>
but never adventure a movement; and except some few affairs at
the pickets,<br>
there is really nothing to do."</p>

<p>"No matter, remaining here can never serve one's interests,
and besides, I<br>
have accomplished what I came for&mdash;"</p>

<p>I was about to add, "the restoration of my health," when he
suddenly<br>
interrupted me, eying me fixedly as he spoke.</p>

<p>"Indeed! indeed! Is that so?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said I, half puzzled at the tone and manner of the
speech; "I can<br>
join now when I please; meanwhile, Fred, I have been thinking of
you. Yes,<br>
don't be surprised, at the very moment we met you were in my
thoughts."</p>

<p>I took his arm as I said this, and led him down the alley.</p>

<p>"We are too old and, I trust, too true friends, Fred, to have
secrets from<br>
each other, and yet we have been playing this silly game for some
weeks<br>
past. Now, my dear fellow, I have yours, and it is only fair
justice you<br>
should have mine, and, faith, I feel you'd have discovered it
long since,<br>
had your thoughts been as free as I have known them to be. Fred,
you are in<br>
love; there, don't wince, man, I know it; but hear me out. You
believe me<br>
to be so also; nay, more, you think that my chances of success
are better,<br>
stronger than your own; learn, then, that I have
none,&mdash;absolutely none.<br>
Don't interrupt me now, for this avowal cuts me deeply; my own
heart alone<br>
knows what I suffer as I record my wrecked fortunes; but I repeat
it, my<br>
hopes are at end forever; but, Fred, my boy, I cannot lose my
friend too.<br>
If I have been the obstacle to your path, I am so no more. Ask me
not why;<br>
it is enough that I speak in all truth and sincerity. Ere three
days I<br>
shall leave this, and with it all the hopes that once beamed upon
my<br>
fortunes, and all the happiness,&mdash;nay, not all, my boy, for I
feel some<br>
thrill at my heart yet, as I think that I have been true to
you."</p>

<p>I know not what more I spoke nor how he replied to me. I felt
the warm<br>
grasp of his hand, I saw his delighted smile; the words of
grateful<br>
acknowledgment his lips uttered conveyed but an imperfect meaning
to my<br>
ear, and I remembered no more.</p>

<p>The courage which sustained me for the moment sank gradually
as I meditated<br>
over my avowal, and I could scarce help accusing Power of a
breach of<br>
friendship for exacting a confession which, in reality, I had
volunteered<br>
to give him. How Lucy herself would think of my conduct was ever
occurring<br>
to my thoughts, and I felt, as I ruminated upon the conjectures
it might<br>
give rise to, how much more likely a favorable opinion might now
be formed<br>
of me, than when such an estimation could have crowned me with
delight.</p>

<p>"Yes," thought I, "she will at last learn to know him who
loved her with<br>
truth and with devoted affection; and when the blight of all his
hopes is<br>
accomplished, the fair fame of his fidelity will be proved. The
march,<br>
the bivouac, the battle-field, are now all to me; and the
campaign alone<br>
presents a prospect which may fill up the aching void that
disappointed and<br>
ruined hopes have left behind them."</p>

<p>How I longed for the loud call of the trumpet, the clash of
the steel, the<br>
tramp of the war-horse; though the proud distinction of a
soldier's life<br>
were less to me in the distance than the mad and whirlwind
passion of a<br>
charge, and the loud din of the rolling artillery.</p>

<p>It was only some hours after, as I sat alone in my chamber,
that all the<br>
circumstances of our meeting came back clearly to my memory, and
I could<br>
not help muttering to myself,&mdash;</p>

<p>"It is indeed a hard lot, that to cheer the heart of my
friend, I must bear<br>
witness to the despair that shed darkness on my own."</p>

<br><br><br><br><p>CHAPTER XVI.</p>

<p>MY CHARGER.</p>

<p>Although I felt my heart relieved of a heavy load by the
confession I had<br>
made to Power, yet still I shrank from meeting him for some days
after;<br>
a kind of fear lest he should in any way recur to our
conversation<br>
continually beset me, and I felt that the courage which bore me
up for my<br>
first effort would desert me on the next occasion.</p>

<p>My determination to join my regiment was now made up, and I
sent forward a<br>
resignation of my appointment to Sir George Dashwood's staff,
which I<br>
had never been in health to fulfil, and commenced with energy all
my<br>
preparations for a speedy departure.</p>

<p>The reply to my rather formal letter was a most kind note
written by<br>
himself. He regretted the unhappy cause which had so long
separated us, and<br>
though wishing, as he expressed it, to have me near him,
perfectly approved<br>
of my resolution.</p>

<p>    "Active service alone, my dear boy, can ever place you in
the<br>
    position you ought to occupy; and I rejoice the more at your
decision<br>
    in this matter, as I feared the truth of certain reports
here,<br>
    which attributed to you other plans than those which a
campaign<br>
    suggests. My mind is now easy on this score, and I pray you
forgive<br>
    me if my congratulations are <i>mal &agrave; propos</i>."</p>

<p>After some hints for my future management, and a promise of
some letters to<br>
his friends at headquarters, he concluded:&mdash;</p>

<p>    "As this climate does not seem to suit my daughter, I
have<br>
    applied for a change, and am in daily hope of obtaining it.
Before<br>
    going, however, I must beg your acceptance of the charger
which my<br>
    groom will deliver to your servant with this. I was so struck
with<br>
    his figure and action that I purchased him before leaving
England<br>
    without well knowing why or wherefore. Pray let him see
some<br>
    service under your auspices, which he is most unlikely to do
under<br>
    mine. He has plenty of bone to be a weight carrier, and they
tell<br>
    me also that he has speed enough for anything."</p>

<p>Mike's voice in the lawn beneath interrupted my reading
farther, and on<br>
looking out, I perceived him and Sir George Dashwood's servant
standing<br>
beside a large and striking-looking horse, which they were both
examining<br>
with all the critical accuracy of adepts.</p>

<p>"Arrah, isn't he a darling, a real beauty, every inch of
him?"</p>

<p>"That 'ere splint don't signify nothing; he aren't the worse
of it," said<br>
the English groom.</p>

<p>"Of coorse it doesn't," replied Mike. "What a fore-hand, and
the legs,<br>
clean as a whip!"</p>

<p>"There's the best of him, though," interrupted the other,
patting the<br>
strong hind-quarters with his hand. "There's the stuff to push
him along<br>
through heavy ground and carry him over timber."</p>

<p>"Or a stone wall," said Mike, thinking of Galway.</p>

<p>My own impatience to survey my present had now brought me into
the<br>
conclave, and before many minutes were over I had him saddled,
and was<br>
cantering around the lawn with a spirit and energy I had not felt
for<br>
months long. Some small fences lay before me, and over these he
carried me<br>
with all the ease and freedom of a trained hunter. My courage
mounted with<br>
the excitement, and I looked eagerly around for some more bold
and dashing<br>
leap.</p>

<p>"You may take him over the avenue gate," said the English
groom, divining<br>
with a jockey's readiness what I looked for; "he'll do it, never
fear him."</p>

<p>Strange as my equipment was, with an undress jacket flying
loosely open,<br>
and a bare head, away I went. The gate which the groom spoke of
was a<br>
strongly-barred one of oak timber, nearly five feet high,&mdash;its
difficulty<br>
as a leap only consisted in the winding approach, and the fact
that it<br>
opened upon a hard road beyond it.</p>

<p>In a second or two a kind of half fear came across me. My long
illness had<br>
unnerved me, and my limbs felt weak and yielding; but as I
pressed into the<br>
canter, that secret sympathy between the horse and his rider shot
suddenly<br>
through me, I pressed my spurs to his flanks, and dashed him at
it.</p>

<p>Unaccustomed to such treatment, the noble animal bounded madly
forward.<br>
With two tremendous plunges he sprang wildly in the air, and
shaking his<br>
long mane with passion, stretched out at the gallop.</p>

<a name="0124"></a>
<img alt="0124.jpg (204K)" src="0124.jpg" height="719" width="805">

<p>[CHARLEY TRYING A CHARGER.]</p>
<br><br>


<p>My own blood boiled now as tempestuously as his; and with a
shout of<br>
reckless triumph, I rose him at the gate. Just at the instant two
figures<br>
appeared before it,&mdash;the copse had concealed their approach
hitherto,&mdash;but<br>
they stood now as if transfixed. The wild attitude of the horse,
the not<br>
less wild cry of his rider, had deprived them for a time of all
energy; and<br>
overcome by the sudden danger, they seemed rooted to the ground.
What I<br>
said, spoke, begged, or imprecated, Heaven knows&mdash;not I. But they
stirred<br>
not! One moment more and they must lie trampled beneath my
horse's<br>
hoofs,&mdash;he was already on his haunches for the bound,&mdash;when,
wheeling half<br>
aside, I faced him at the wall. It was at least a foot higher and
of solid<br>
stone masonry, and as I did so I felt that I was perilling my
life to save<br>
theirs. One vigorous dash of the spur I gave him, as I lifted him
to the<br>
leap. He bounded beneath it quick as lightning; still, with a
spring like<br>
a rocket, he rose into the air, cleared the wall, and stood
trembling and<br>
frightened on the road outside.</p>

<p>"Safe, by Jupiter! and splendidly done, too," cried a voice
near me, that I<br>
immediately recognized as Sir George Dashwood's.</p>

<p>"Lucy, my love, look up,&mdash;Lucy, my dear, there's no danger
now. She has<br>
fainted! O'Malley, fetch some water,&mdash;fast. Poor fellow, your own
nerves<br>
seem shaken. Why, you've let your horse go! Come here, for
Heaven's sake!<br>
Support her for an instant. I'll fetch some water."</p>

<p>It appeared to me like a dream; I leaned against the pillar of
the gate;<br>
the cold and death-like features of Lucy Dashwood lay motionless
upon my<br>
arm; her hand, falling heavily upon my shoulder, touched my
cheek. The<br>
tramp of my horse, as he galloped onward, was the only sound that
broke the<br>
silence, as I stood there, gazing steadfastly upon the pale brow
and paler<br>
cheek, down which a solitary tear was slowly stealing. I knew not
how the<br>
minutes passed; my memory took no note of time, but at length a
gentle<br>
tremor thrilled her frame, a slight, scarce-perceptible blush
colored her<br>
fair face, her lips slightly parted, and heaving a deep sigh, she
looked<br>
around her. Gradually her eyes turned and met mine. Oh, the
bliss<br>
unutterable of that moment! It was no longer the look of cold
scorn she had<br>
given me last; the expression was one of soft and speaking
gratitude. She<br>
seemed to read my very heart, and know its truth; there was a
tone of deep<br>
and compassionate interest in the glance; and forgetting
all,&mdash;everything<br>
that had passed,&mdash;all save my unaltered, unalterable love, I
kneeled beside<br>
her, and in words burning as my own heart burned, poured out my
tale<br>
of mingled sorrow and affection with all the eloquence of
passion. I<br>
vindicated my unshaken faith,&mdash;reconciling the conflicting
evidences with<br>
the proofs I proffered of my attachment. If my moments were
measured, I<br>
spent them not idly. I called to witness how every action of my
soldier's<br>
life emanated from her; how her few and chance words had decided
the<br>
character of my fate; if aught of fame or honor were my portion,
to her I<br>
owed it. As, hurried onwards by my ardent hopes, I forgot Power
and all<br>
about him, a step up the gravel walk came rapidly nearer, and I
had but<br>
time to assume my former attitude beside Lucy as her father came
up.</p>

<p>"Well, Charley, is she better? Oh, I see she is. Here, we have
the whole<br>
household at our heels." So saying, he pointed to a string of
servants<br>
pressing eagerly forward with every species of restorative that
Portuguese<br>
ingenuity has invented.</p>

<p>The next moment we were joined by the senhora, who, pale with
fear, seemed<br>
scarcely less in need of assistance than her friend.</p>

<p>Amidst questions innumerable; explanations sought for on all
sides;<br>
mistakes and misconceptions as to the whole occurrence,&mdash;we took
our way<br>
towards the villa, Lucy walking between Sir George and Donna
Inez, while I<br>
followed, leaning upon Power's arm.</p>

<p>"They've caught him again, O'Malley," said the general,
turning half round<br>
to me; "he, too, seemed as much frightened as any of us."</p>

<p>"It is time, Sir George, I should think of thanking you. I
never was so<br>
mounted in my life&mdash;"</p>

<p>"A splendid charger, by Jove!" said Power; "but, Charley, my
lad, no more<br>
feats of this nature, if you love me. No girl's heart will stand
such<br>
continual assaults as your winning horsemanship submits it
to."</p>

<p>I was about making some half-angry reply, when he continued:
"There, don't<br>
look sulky; I have news for you. Quill has just arrived. I met
him at<br>
Lisbon; he has got leave of absence for a few days, and is coming
to our<br>
masquerade here this evening."</p>

<p>"This evening!" said I, in amazement; "why, is it so
soon?"</p>

<p>"Of course it is. Have you not got all your trappings ready?
The Dashwoods<br>
came out here on purpose to spend the day; but come, I'll drive
you into<br>
town. My tilbury is ready, and we'll both look out for our
costumes." So<br>
saying, he led me along towards the house, when, after a rapid
change of my<br>
toilet, we set out for Lisbon.</p>

<br><br><br><br><p>CHAPTER XVII.</p>

<p>MAURICE.</p>

<p>It seemed a conceded matter between Power and myself that we
should never<br>
recur to the conversation we held in the garden; and so, although
we dined<br>
<i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i> that day, neither of us
ventured, by any allusion the most<br>
distant, to advert to what it was equally evident was uppermost
in the<br>
minds of both.</p>

<p>All our endeavors, therefore, to seem easy and unconcerned
were in vain;<br>
a restless anxiety to seem interested about things and persons we
were<br>
totally indifferent to, pervaded all our essays at conversation.
By<br>
degrees, we grew weary of the parts we were acting, and each
relapsed<br>
into a moody silence, thinking over his plans and projects, and
totally<br>
forgetting the existence of the other.</p>

<p>The decanter was passed across the table without speaking, a
half nod<br>
intimated the bottle was standing; and except an occasional
malediction<br>
upon an intractable cigar, nothing was heard.</p>

<p>Such was the agreeable occupation we were engaged in, when,
towards nine<br>
o'clock, the door opened, and the great Maurice himself stood
before us.</p>

<p>"Pleasant fellows, upon my conscience, and jovial over their
liquor!<br>
Confound your smoking! That may do very well in a bivouac. Let us
have<br>
something warm!"</p>

<p>Quill's interruption was a most welcome one to both parties,
and we<br>
rejoiced with a sincere pleasure at his coming.</p>

<p>"What shall it be, Maurice? Port or sherry mulled, and an
anchovy?"</p>

<p>"Or what say you to a bowl of bishop?" said I.</p>

<p>"Hurrah for the Church, Charley! Let us have the bishop; and
not to<br>
disparage Fred's taste, we'll be eating the anchovy while the
liquor's<br>
concocting."</p>

<p>"Well, Maurice, and now for the news. How are matters at
Torres Vedras?<br>
Anything like movement in that quarter?"</p>

<p>"Nothing very remarkable. Massena made a reconnoissance some
days since,<br>
and one of our batteries threw a shower of grape among the staff,
which<br>
spoiled the procession, and sent them back in very disorderly
time. Then<br>
we've had a few skirmishes to the front with no great results,&mdash;a
few<br>
courts-martial, bad grub, and plenty of grumbling."</p>

<p>"Why, what would they have? It's a great thing to hold the
French army in<br>
check within a few marches of Lisbon."</p>

<p>"Charley, my man, who cares twopence for the French army or
Lisbon or the<br>
Portuguese or the Junta or anything about it?&mdash;every man is
pondering over<br>
his own affairs. One fellow wants to get home again, and be sent
upon some<br>
recruiting station. Another wishes to get a step or two in
promotion, to<br>
come to Torres Vedras, where even the <i>grande arm&eacute;e</i>
can't. Then some of us<br>
are in love, and some of us are in debt. Their is neither glory
nor profit<br>
to be had. But here's the bishop, smoking and steaming with an
odor of<br>
nectar!"</p>

<p>"And our fellows, have you seen them lately?"</p>

<p>"I dined with yours on Tuesday. Was it Tuesday? Yes. I dined
with them.<br>
By-the-bye, Sparks was taken prisoner that morning."</p>

<p>"Sparks taken prisoner! Poor fellow. I am sincerely sorry. How
did it<br>
happen, Maurice?"</p>

<p>"Very simply. Sparks had a forage patrol towards Vieda, and
set out early<br>
in the morning with his party. It seemed that they succeeded
perfectly, and<br>
were returning to the lines, when poor Sparks, always susceptible
where the<br>
sex are concerned, saw, or thought he saw, a lattice gently open
as he rode<br>
from the village, and a very taper finger make a signal to him.
Dropping a<br>
little behind the rest, he waited till his men had debouched upon
the road,<br>
when riding quietly up, he coughed a couple of times to attract
the fair<br>
unknown; a handkerchief waved from the lattice in reply, which
was speedily<br>
closed, and our valiant cornet accordingly dismounted and entered
the<br>
house.</p>

<p>"The remainder of the adventure is soon told; for in a few
seconds after,<br>
two men mounted on one horse were seen galloping at top speed
towards the<br>
French lines,&mdash;the foremost being a French officer of the 4th
Cuirassiers,<br>
the gentleman with his face to the tail, our friend Sparks; the
lovely<br>
unknown being a, <i>vieille moustache</i> of Loison's corps, who had
been<br>
wounded in a skirmish some days before, and lay waiting an
opportunity of<br>
rejoining his party. One of our prisoners knew this fellow well;
he had<br>
been promoted from the ranks, and was a Hercules for feats of
strength; so<br>
that, after all, Sparks could not help himself."</p>

<p>"Well, I'm really sorry; but as you say, Sparks's tender
nature is always<br>
the ruin of him."</p>

<p>"Of him! ay, and of you; and of Power; and of myself; of all
of us. Isn't<br>
it the sweet creatures that make fools of us from Father Adam
down to<br>
Maurice Quill, neither sparing age nor rank in the service,
half-pay nor<br>
the veteran battalion&mdash;it's all one? Pass the jug, there.
O'Shaughnessy&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ah, by-the-bye, how's the major?"</p>

<p>"Charmingly; only a little bit in a scrape just now. Sir
Arthur&mdash;Lord<br>
Wellington, I mean&mdash;had him up for his fellows being caught
pillaging, and<br>
gave him a devil of a rowing a few days ago.</p>

<p>"'Very disorderly corps yours, Major O'Shaughnessy,' said the
general;<br>
'more men up for punishment than any regiment in the
service.'</p>

<p>"Shaugh muttered something; but his voice was lost in a
loud<br>
cock-a-doo-do-doo, that some bold chanticleer set up at the
moment.</p>

<p>"'If the officers do their duty, Major O'Shaughnessy, these
acts of<br>
insubordination do not occur.'</p>

<p>"'Cock-a-doo-do-doo,' was the reply. Some of the staff found
it hard not to<br>
laugh; but the general went on,&mdash;</p>

<p>"'If, therefore, the practice does not cease, I'll draft the
men into West<br>
India regiments.'</p>

<p>"'Cock-a-doo-do-doo.'</p>

<p>"'And if any articles pillaged from the inhabitants are
detected in the<br>
quarters, or about the person of the troops&mdash;'</p>

<p>"'Cock-a-doo-do-<i>doo</i>,' screamed louder here than ever.</p>

<p>"'Damn that cock! Where is it?'</p>

<p>"There was a general look around on all sides, which seemed in
vain; when<br>
a tremendous repetition of the cry resounded from O'Shaughnessy's
coat<br>
pocket,&mdash;thus detecting the valiant major himself in the very
practice of<br>
his corps. There was no standing this: every one burst out into a
peal of<br>
laughing; and Lord Wellington himself could not resist, but
turned away,<br>
muttering to himself as he went, 'Damned robbers&mdash;every man of
them!' while<br>
a final war-note from the major's pocket closed the
interview."</p>

<p>"Confound you, Maurice, you've always some villanous narrative
or other.<br>
You never crossed a street for shelter without making something
out of it."</p>

<p>"True this time, as sure as my name's Maurice; but the bowl is
empty."</p>

<p>"Never mind, here comes its successor. How long can you stay
among us?"</p>

<p>"A few days at most. Just took a run off to see the sights. I
was all over<br>
Lisbon this morning; saw the Inquisition and the cells and the
place where<br>
they tried the fellows,&mdash;the kind of grand jury room with the
great picture<br>
of Adam and Eve at the end of it. What a beautiful creature she
is; hair<br>
down to her waist, and such eyes! 'Ah, ye darling!' said I to
myself,<br>
'small blame to him for what he did. Wouldn't I ate every crab in
the<br>
garden, if ye asked me!'"</p>

<p>"I must certainly go to see her, Maurice. Is she very
Portuguese in her<br>
style?"</p>

<p>"Devil a bit of it! She might be a Limerick-woman with elegant
brown hair<br>
and blue eyes and a skin like snow."</p>

<p>"Come, come, they've pretty girls in Lisbon too, Doctor."</p>

<p>"Yes, faith," said Power, "that they have."</p>

<p>"Nothing like Ireland, boys; not a bit of it; they're the
girls for my<br>
money; and where's the man can resist them? From Saint Patrick,
that had to<br>
go and live in the Wicklow mountains&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Saint Kevin, you mean, Doctor."</p>

<p>"Sure it's all the same, they were twins. I made a little song
about them<br>
one evening last week,&mdash;the women I mean."</p>

<p>"Let us have it, Maurice; let us have it, old fellow. What's
the measure?"</p>

<p>"Short measure; four little verses, devil a more!"</p>

<p>"But the time, I mean?"</p>

<p>"Whenever you like to sing it; here it is,"&mdash;</p>

<p>    THE GIRLS OF THE WEST.</p>

<p>    Air,&mdash;"<i>Teddy, ye Gander</i>."</p>

<p>    (<i>With feeling: but not too slow</i>.)</p>

<p>    You may talk, if you please,<br>
    Of the brown Portuguese,<br>
    But wherever you roam, wherever you roam,<br>
    You nothing will meet,<br>
    Half so lovely or sweet,<br>
    As the girls at home, the girls at home.</p>

<p>    Their eyes are not sloes,<br>
    Nor so long is their nose,<br>
    But between me and you, between me and you,<br>
    They are just as alarming,<br>
    And ten times more charming,<br>
    With hazel and blue, with hazel and blue.</p>

<p>    They don't ogle a man,<br>
    O'er the top of their fan<br>
    Till his heart's in a flame, till his heart's in a flame<br>
    But though bashful and shy,<br>
    They've a look in their eye<br>
    That just comes to the same, just comes to the same.</p>

<p>    No mantillas they sport,<br>
    But a petticoat short<br>
    Shows an ankle the best, an ankle the best,<br>
    And a leg&mdash;but, O murther!<br>
    I dare not go further;<br>
    So here's to the west, so here's to the west.</p>

<p>"Now that really is a sweet little thing. Moore's isn't
it?"</p>

<p>"Not a bit of it; my own muse, every word of it."</p>

<p>"And the music?" said I.</p>

<p>"My own, too. Too much spice in that bowl; that's an
invariable error in<br>
your devisers of drink, to suppose that the tipple you start with
can<br>
please your palate to the last; they forget that as we advance,
either in<br>
years or lush, our tastes simplify."</p>

<p>"<i>Nous revenons &agrave; nos premi&egrave;res amours</i>. Isn't
that it?"</p>

<p>"No, not exactly, for we go even further; for if you mark the
progression<br>
of a sensible man's fluids, you'll find what an emblem of life it
presents<br>
to you. What is his initiatory glass of 'Chablis' that he throws
down with<br>
his oysters but the budding expectancy of boyhood,&mdash;the
appetizing sense of<br>
pleasure to come; then follows the sherry with his soup, that
warming glow<br>
which strength and vigor in all their consciousness impart, as a
glimpse of<br>
life is opening before him. Then youth succeeds&mdash;buoyant, wild,
tempestuous<br>
youth&mdash;foaming and sparkling like the bright champagne whose
stormy surface<br>
subsides into a myriad of bright stars."</p>

<p>"<i>Oeil de perdrix</i>."</p>

<p>"Not a bit of it; woman's own eye, brilliant, sparkling,
life-giving&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Devil take the fellow, he's getting poetical!"</p>

<p>"Ah, Fred! if that could only last; but one must come to the
burgundies<br>
with his maturer years. Your first glass of hermitage is the
algebraic sign<br>
for five-and-thirty,&mdash;the glorious burst is over; the pace is
still good,<br>
to be sure, but the great enthusiasm is past. You can afford to
look<br>
forward, but confound it, you've along way to look back
also."</p>

<p>"I say, Charley, our friend has contrived to finish the bishop
during his<br>
disquisition; the bowl's quite empty."</p>

<p>"You don't say so, Fred. To be sure, how a man does forget
himself in<br>
abstract speculations; but let us have a little more, I've not
concluded my<br>
homily."</p>

<p>"Not a glass, Maurice; it's already past nine. We are all
pledged to<br>
the masquerade, and before we've dressed and got there, 't will
be late<br>
enough."</p>

<p>"But I'm not disguised yet, my boy, nor half."</p>

<p>"Well, they must take you <i>au naturel</i>, as our countrymen do
their<br>
potatoes."</p>

<p>"Yes, Doctor, Fred's right; we had better start."</p>

<p>"Well, I can't help it; I've recorded my opposition to the
motion, but I<br>
must submit; and now that I'm on my legs, explain to me what's
that very<br>
dull-looking old lamp up there?"</p>

<p>"That's the moon, man; the full moon."</p>

<p>"Well, I've no objection; I'm full too: so come along,
lads."</p>

<br><br><br><br><p>CHAPTER XVIII.</p>

<p>THE MASQUERADE.</p>

<p>To form one's impression of a masked ball from the attempts at
this mode<br>
of entertainment in our country, is but to conceive a most
imperfect and<br>
erroneous notion. With us, the first <i>coup d'oeil</i> is everything;
the<br>
nuns, the shepherdesses, the Turks, sailors, eastern princes,
watchmen,<br>
moonshees, milestones, devils, and Quakers are all very well in
their way<br>
as they pass in the review before us, but when we come to mix in
the<br>
crowd, we discover that, except the turban and the cowl, the
crook and<br>
the broad-brim, no further disguise is attempted or thought of.
The nun,<br>
forgetting her vow and her vestments, is flirting with the devil;
the<br>
watchman, a very fastidious elegant, is ogling the fishwomen
through his<br>
glass; while the Quaker is performing a <i>pas seul</i> Alberti might
be proud<br>
of, in a quadrille of riotous Turks and half-tipsy Hindoos; in
fact, the<br>
whole wit of the scene consists in absurd associations. Apart
from this,<br>
the actors have rarely any claims upon your attention; for even
supposing<br>
a person clever enough to sustain his character, whatever it be,
you must<br>
also supply the other personages of the drama, or, in stage
phrase, he'll<br>
have nothing to "play up to." What would be Bardolph without
Pistol; what<br>
Sir Lucius O'Triuger without Acres? It is the relief which throws
out the<br>
disparities and contradictions of life that afford us most
amusement; hence<br>
it is that one swallow can no more make a summer, than one
well-sustained<br>
character can give life to a masquerade. Without such sympathies,
such<br>
points of contact, all the leading features of the individual,
making him<br>
act and be acted upon, are lost; the characters being mere
parallel lines,<br>
which, however near they approach, never bisect or cross each
other.</p>

<p>This is not the case abroad: the domino, which serves for mere
concealment,<br>
is almost the only dress assumed, and the real disguise is
therefore thrown<br>
from necessity upon the talents, whatever they be, of the wearer.
It is<br>
no longer a question of a beard or a spangled mantle, a Polish
dress or<br>
a pasteboard nose; the mutation of voice, the assumption of a
different<br>
manner, walk, gesture, and mode of expression, are all necessary,
and no<br>
small tact is required to effect this successfully.</p>

<p>I may be pardoned this little digression, as it serves to
explain in some<br>
measure how I felt on entering the splendidly lit up <i>salons</i> of
the<br>
villa, crowded with hundreds of figures in all the varied
costumes of a<br>
carnival,&mdash;the sounds of laughter mingled with the crash of the
music;<br>
the hurrying hither and thither of servants with refreshments;
the crowds<br>
gathered around fortune-tellers, whose predictions threw the
parties<br>
at each moment into shouts of merriment; the eager following of
some<br>
disappointed domino, interrogating every one to find out a lost
mask.<br>
For some time I stood an astonished spectator at the kind of
secret<br>
intelligence which seemed to pervade the whole assemblage, when
suddenly a<br>
mask, who for some time had been standing beside me, whispered in
French,&mdash;</p>

<p>"If you pass your time in this manner, you must not feel
surprised if your<br>
place be occupied."</p>

<p>I turned hastily round, but she was gone. She, I say, for the
voice was<br>
clearly a woman's; her pink domino could be no guide, for
hundreds of the<br>
same color passed me every instant. The meaning of the allusion I
had<br>
little doubt of. I turned to speak to Power, but he was gone; and
for the<br>
first moment of my life, the bitterness of rivalry crossed my
mind. It was<br>
true I had resigned all pretensions in his favor. My last meeting
with Lucy<br>
had been merely to justify my own character against an impression
that<br>
weighed heavily on me; still, I thought he might have
waited,&mdash;another day<br>
and I should be far away, neither to witness nor grieve over his
successes.</p>

<p>"You still hesitate," whispered some one near me.</p>

<p>I wheeled round suddenly, but could not detect the speaker,
and was again<br>
relapsing into my own musings, when the same voice
repeated,&mdash;</p>

<p>"The white domino with the blue cape. Adieu."</p>

<p>Without waiting to reflect upon the singularity of the
occurrence, I now<br>
hurried along through the dense crowd, searching on every side
for the<br>
domino.</p>

<p>"Isn't that O'Malley?" said an Englishman to his friend.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied the other; "the very man we want. O'Malley,
find a partner;<br>
we have been searching a <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> this ten
minutes."</p>

<p>The speaker was an officer I had met at Sir George Dashwood's.
"How did you<br>
discover me?" said I, suddenly.</p>

<p>"Not a very difficult thing if you carry your mask in your
hand that way,"<br>
was the answer.</p>

<p>And I now perceived that in the distraction of my thoughts I
had been<br>
carrying my mask in this manner since my coming into the
room.</p>

<p>"There now, what say you to the blue domino? I saw her foot,
and a girl<br>
with such an instep must be a waltzer."</p>

<p>I looked round, a confused effort at memory passing across my
mind; my eyes<br>
fell at the instant upon the embroidered sleeve of the domino,
where a<br>
rosebud worked in silver at once reminded me of Catrina's secret.
"Ah,"<br>
thought I, "La Senhora herself!" She was leaning upon the arm of
a tall and<br>
portly figure in black; who this was I knew not, nor sought to
discover,<br>
but at once advancing towards Donna Inez asked her to waltz.</p>

<p>Without replying to me she turned towards her companion, who
seemed as it<br>
were to press her acceptance of my offer; she hesitated, however,
for an<br>
instant, and curtsying deeply, declined it. "Well," thought I,
"she at<br>
least has not recognized me."</p>

<p>"And yet, Senhora," said I, half jestingly, "I <i>have</i> seen you
join a<br>
bolero before now."</p>

<p>"You evidently mistake me," was the reply, but in a voice so
well feigned<br>
as almost to convince me she was right.</p>

<p>"Nay, more," said I, "under your own fair auspices did I
myself first<br>
adventure one."</p>

<p>"Still in error, believe me; I am not known to you."</p>

<p>"And yet I have a talisman to refresh your memory, should you
dare me<br>
further."</p>

<p>At this instant my hand was grasped warmly by a passing mask.
I turned<br>
round rapidly, and Power whispered in my ear,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Yours forever, Charley; you've made my fortune."</p>

<p>As he hurried on I could perceive that he supported a lady on
his arm, and<br>
that she wore a loose white domino with a deep blue cape. In a
second all<br>
thought of Inez was forgotten, and anxious only to conceal my
emotion, I<br>
turned away and mingled in the crowd. Lost to all around me, I
wandered<br>
carelessly, heedlessly on, neither noticing the glittering throng
around,<br>
nor feeling a thought in common with the gay and joyous spirits
that<br>
flitted by. The night wore on, my melancholy and depression
growing ever<br>
deeper, yet so spell-bound was I that I could not leave the
place. A<br>
secret sense that it was the last time we were to meet had gained
entire<br>
possession of me, and I longed to speak a few words ere we parted
forever.</p>

<p>I was leaning on a window which looked out upon the courtyard,
when<br>
suddenly the tramp of horses attracted my attention, and I saw by
the<br>
clear moonlight a group of mounted men, whose long cloaks and
tall helmets<br>
announced dragoons, standing around the porch. At the same moment
the<br>
door of the <i>salon</i> opened, and an officer in undress, splashed
and<br>
travel-stained, entered. Making his way rapidly through the
crowd, he<br>
followed the servant, who introduced him towards the supper-room.
Thither<br>
the dense mass now pressed to learn the meaning of the singular
apparition;<br>
while my own curiosity, not less excited, led me towards the
door. As<br>
I crossed the hall, however, my progress was interrupted by a
group of<br>
persons, among whom I saw an aide-de-camp of Lord Wellington's
staff,<br>
narrating, as it were, some piece of newly-arrived intelligence.
I had<br>
no time for further inquiry, when a door opened near me, and Sir
George<br>
Dashwood, accompanied by several general officers, came forth,
the officer<br>
I had first seen enter the ball-room along with them. Every one
was by this<br>
unmasked, and eagerly looking to hear what had occurred.</p>

<p>"Then, Dashwood, you'll send off an orderly at once?" said an
old general<br>
officer beside me.</p>

<p>"This instant, my Lord. I'll despatch an aide-de-camp. The
troops shall be<br>
in marching order before noon. Oh, here's the man I want!
O'Malley, come<br>
here. Mount your horse and dash into town. Send for Brotherton
and M'Gregor<br>
to quarters, and announce the news as quickly as possible."</p>

<p>"But what am I to announce, Sir George?"</p>

<p>"That the French are in retreat,&mdash;Massena in retreat, my
lad."</p>

<p>A tremendous cheer at this instant burst from the hundreds in
the<br>
<i>salon</i>, who now heard the glorious tidings. Another cheer and
another<br>
followed,&mdash;ten thousand <i>vivas</i> rose amidst the crash of the
band, as it<br>
broke into a patriotic war chant. Such a scene of enthusiasm and
excitement<br>
I never witnessed. Some wept with joy. Others threw themselves
into their<br>
friends' arms.</p>

<p>"They're all mad, every mother's son of them!" said Maurice
Quill, as he<br>
elbowed his way through the mass; "and here's an old vestal won't
leave my<br>
arm. She has already embraced me three times, and we've finished
a flask of<br>
Malaga between us."</p>

<p>"Come, O'Malley, are you ready for the road?"</p>

<p>My horse was by this time standing saddled at the front. I
sprang at once<br>
to the saddle, and without waiting for a second order, set out
for Lisbon.<br>
Ten minutes had scarce elapsed,&mdash;the very shouts of joy of the
delighted<br>
city were still ringing in my ears,&mdash;when I was once again back
at the<br>
villa. As I mounted the steps into the hall, a carriage drew
up,&mdash;it was<br>
Sir George Dashwood's. He came forward, his daughter leaning upon
his arm.</p>

<p>"Why, O'Malley, I thought you had gone."</p>

<p>"I have returned, Sir George. Colonel Brotherton is in
waiting, and the<br>
staff also. I have received orders to set out for Benejos, where
the 14th<br>
are stationed, and have merely delayed to say adieu."</p>

<p>"Adieu, my dear boy, and God bless you!" said the warm-hearted
old man, as<br>
he pressed my hand between both his. "Lucy, here's your old
friend about to<br>
leave; come and say good-by."</p>

<p>Miss Dashwood had stopped behind to adjust her shawl. I flew
to her<br>
assistance. "Adieu, Miss Dashwood, and forever!" said I, in a
broken voice,<br>
as I took her hand in mine. "This is not your domino," said I,
eagerly, as<br>
a blue silk one peeped from beneath her mantle; "and the sleeve,
too,&mdash;did<br>
you wear this?" She blushed slightly, and assented.</p>

<p>"I changed with the senhora, who wore mine all the
evening."</p>

<p>"And Power, then, was not your partner?"</p>

<p>"I should think not,&mdash;for I never danced."</p>

<p>"Lucy, my love, are you ready? Come, be quick."</p>

<p>"Good-by, Mr. O'Malley, and <i>au revoir, n'est-ce pas?</i>"</p>

<p>I drew her glove from her hand as she spoke, and pressing my
lips upon her<br>
fingers, placed her within the carriage. "Adieu, and <i>au
revoir!</i>" said I.<br>
The carriage turned away, and a white glove was all that remained
to me of<br>
Lucy Dashwood!</p>

<p>The carriage had turned the angle of the road, and its
retiring sounds were<br>
growing gradually fainter, ere I recovered myself sufficiently to
know<br>
where I stood. One absorbing thought alone possessed me. Lucy was
not lost<br>
to me forever; Power was not my rival in that quarter,&mdash;that was
enough for<br>
me. I needed no more to nerve my arm and steel my heart. As I
reflected<br>
thus, the long loud blast of a trumpet broke upon the silence of
the<br>
night, and admonished me to depart. I hurried to my room to make
my few<br>
preparations for the road; but Mike had already anticipated
everything<br>
here, and all was in readiness.</p>

<p>But one thing now remained,&mdash;to make my adieu to the senhora.
With this<br>
intent, I descended a narrow winding stair which led from my
dressing-room,<br>
and opened by a little terrace upon the flower-garden beside
her<br>
apartments.</p>

<p>As I crossed the gravelled alley, I could not but think of the
last time I<br>
had been there. It was on the eve of departure for the Douro. I
recalled<br>
the few and fleeting moments of our leave-taking, and a thought
flashed<br>
upon me,&mdash;what if she cared for me! What if, half in coquetry,
half in<br>
reality, her heart was mixed up in those passages which daily
association<br>
gives rise to?</p>

<p>I could not altogether acquit myself of all desire to make her
believe me<br>
her admirer; nay, more, with the indolent <i>abandon</i> of my
country, I had<br>
fallen into a thousand little schemes to cheat the long hours
away, which,<br>
having no other object than the happiness of the moment, might
yet color<br>
all her after-life with sorrow.</p>

<p>Let no one rashly pronounce me a coxcomb, vain and
pretentious, for all<br>
this. In my inmost heart I had no feeling of selfishness mingled
with the<br>
consideration. It was from no sense of my own merits, no
calculation of my<br>
own chances of success, that I thought thus. Fortunately, at
eighteen one's<br>
heart is uncontaminated with such an alloy of vanity. The first
emotions of<br>
youth are pure and holy things, tempering our fiercer passions,
and calming<br>
the rude effervescence of our boyish spirit; and when we strive
to please,<br>
and hope to win affection, we insensibly fashion ourselves to
nobler and<br>
higher thoughts, catching from the source of our devotion a
portion of that<br>
charm that idealizes daily life, and makes our path in it a
glorious and a<br>
bright one.</p>

<p>Who would not exchange all the triumph of his later days, the
proudest<br>
moments of successful ambition, the richest trophies of
hard-won<br>
daring,&mdash;for the short and vivid flash that first shot through
his heart<br>
and told him he was loved. It is the opening consciousness of
life, the<br>
first sense of power that makes of the mere boy a man,&mdash;a man in
all his<br>
daring and his pride; and hence it is that in early life we feel
ever prone<br>
to indulge those fancied attachments which elevate and raise us
in our own<br>
esteem. Such was the frame of my mind when I entered the little
boudoir<br>
where once before I had ventured on a similar errand.</p>

<p>As I closed the sash-door behind me, the gray dawn of breaking
day scarcely<br>
permitted my seeing anything around me, and I felt my way towards
the door<br>
of an adjoining room, where I supposed it was likely I should
find the<br>
senhora. As I proceeded thus, with cautious step and beating
heart, I<br>
thought I heard a sound near me. I stopped and listened, and was
about<br>
again to move on, when a half-stifled sob fell upon my ear.
Slowly and<br>
silently guiding my steps towards the sounds, I reached a sofa,
when, my<br>
eyes growing by degrees more accustomed to the faint light, I
could detect<br>
a figure which, at a glance, I recognized as Donna Inez. A
cashmere shawl<br>
was loosely thrown around her, and her face was buried in her
hands. As she<br>
lay, to all seeming, still and insensible before me, her
beautiful hair<br>
fell heavily upon her back and across her arm, and her whole
attitude<br>
denoted the very abandonment of grief. A short convulsive shudder
which<br>
slightly shook her frame alone gave evidence of life, except when
a sob,<br>
barely audible in the death-like silence, escaped her.</p>

<p>I knelt silently down beside her, and gently withdrawing her
hand, placed<br>
it within mine. A dreadful feeling of self-condemnation shot
through me as<br>
I felt the gentle pressure of her taper fingers, which rested
without a<br>
struggle in my grasp. My tears fell hot and fast upon that pale
hand, as<br>
I bent in sadness over it, unable to utter a word. A rush of
conflicting<br>
thoughts passed through my brain, and I knew not what to do. I
now had no<br>
doubt upon my mind that she loved me, and that her present
affliction was<br>
caused by my approaching departure.</p>

<p>"Dearest Inez!" I stammered out at length, as I pressed her
hands to my<br>
lips,&mdash;"dearest Inez!"&mdash;a faint sob, and a slight pressure of her
hand, was<br>
the only reply. "I have come to say good-by," continued I,
gaining a little<br>
courage as I spoke; "a long good-by, too, in all likelihood. You
have heard<br>
that we are ordered away,&mdash;there, don't sob, dearest, and,
believe me, I<br>
had wished ere we parted to have spoken to you calmly and openly;
but,<br>
alas, I cannot,&mdash;I scarcely know what I say."</p>

<p>"You will not forget me?" said she, in a low voice, that sank
into my very<br>
heart. "You will not forget me?" As she spoke, her hand dropped
heavily<br>
upon my shoulder, and her rich luxuriant hair fell upon my cheek.
What a<br>
devil of a thing is proximity to a downy cheek and a black
eyelash, more<br>
especially when they belong to one whom you are disposed to
believe not<br>
indifferent to you! What I did at this precise moment there is no
necessity<br>
for recording, even had not an adage interdicted such
confessions, nor can<br>
I now remember what I said; but I can well recollect how,
gradually warming<br>
with my subject, I entered into a kind of half-declaration of
attachment,<br>
intended most honestly to be a mere <i>expos&eacute;</i> of my own
unworthiness to win<br>
her favor, and my resolution to leave Lisbon and its neighborhood
forever.</p>

<p>Let not any one blame me rashly if he has not experienced the
difficulty of<br>
my position. The impetus of love-making is like the ardor of a
fox-hunt.<br>
You care little that the six-bar gate before you is the boundary
of another<br>
gentleman's preserves or the fence of his pleasure-ground. You go
slap<br>
along at a smashing-pace, with your head up, and your hand low,
clearing<br>
all before you, the opposing difficulties to your progress giving
half<br>
the zest, because all the danger to your career. So it is with
love; the<br>
gambling spirit urges one ever onward, and the chance of failure
is a<br>
reason for pursuit, where no other argument exists.</p>

<p>"And you do love me?" said the senhora, with a soft, low
whisper that most<br>
unaccountably suggested anything but comfort to me.</p>

<p>"Love you, Inez? By this kiss&mdash;I'm in an infernal scrape!"
said I,<br>
muttering this last half of my sentence to myself.</p>

<p>"And you'll never be jealous again?"</p>

<p>"Never, by all that's lovely!&mdash;your own sweet lips. That's the
very last<br>
thing to reproach me with."</p>

<p>"And you promise me not to mind that foolish boy? For, after
all, you know,<br>
it was mere flirtation,&mdash;if even that."</p>

<p>"I'll never think of him again," said I, while my brain was
burning to make<br>
out her meaning. "But, dearest, there goes the
trumpet-call&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And, as for Pedro Mascarenhas, I never liked him."</p>

<p>"Are you quite sure, Inez?"</p>

<p>"I swear it!&mdash;so no more of him. Gonzales Cordenza&mdash;I've broke
with him<br>
long since. So that you see, dearest Frederic&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Frederic!" said I, starting almost to my feet with,
amazement, while she<br>
continued:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I'm your own,&mdash;all your own!"</p>

<p>"Oh, the coquette, the heartless jilt!" groaned I,
half-aloud.</p>

<p>"And O'Malley, Inez, poor Charley!&mdash;what of him?"</p>

<p>"Poor thing! I can't help him. But he's such a puppy, the
lesson may do him<br>
good."</p>

<p>"But perhaps he loved you, Inez?"</p>

<p>"To be sure he did; I wished him to do so,&mdash;I can't bear not
to be loved.<br>
But, Frederic, tell me, may I trust you,&mdash;will you keep faithful
to me?"</p>

<p>"Sweetest Inez! by this last kiss I swear that such as I kneel
before you<br>
now, you'll ever find me."</p>

<p>A foot upon the gravel-walk without now called me to my feet;
I sprang<br>
towards the door, and before Inez had lifted her head from the
sofa, I had<br>
reached the garden. A figure muffled in a cavalry cloak passed
near me, but<br>
without noticing me, and the next moment I had cleared the
paling, and was<br>
hurrying towards the stable, where I had ordered Mike to be in
waiting.</p>

<p>The faint streak of dull pink which announces the coming day
stretched<br>
beneath the dark clouds of the night, and the chill air of the
morning was<br>
already stirring in the leaves.</p>

<p>As I passed along by a low beech hedge which skirted the
avenue, I was<br>
struck by the sound of voices near me. I stopped to listen, and
soon<br>
detected in one of the speakers my friend Mickey Free; of the
other I was<br>
not long in ignorance.</p>

<p>"Love you, is it, bathershin? It's worship you, adore you,
my<br>
darling,&mdash;that's the word! There, acushla, don't cry; dry your
eyes&mdash;Oh,<br>
murther, it's a cruel thing to tear one's self away from the best
of<br>
living, with the run of the house in drink and kissing! Bad luck
to it for<br>
campaigning, any way, I never liked it!"</p>

<p>Catrina's reply,&mdash;for it was she,&mdash;I could not gather; but
Mike resumed:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Ay, just so, sore bones and wet grass, <i>accadent&eacute;</i>,
and half-rations. Oh,<br>
that I ever saw the day when I took to it! Listen to me now,
honey; here it<br>
is, on my knees I am before you, and throth it's not more nor
three, may be<br>
four, young women I'd say the like to; bad scran to me if I
wouldn't marry<br>
you out of a face this blessed morning just as soon as I'd look
at ye.<br>
Arrah, there now, don't be screeching and bawling; what'll the
neighbors<br>
think of us, and my own heart's destroyed with grief
entirely."</p>

<p>Poor Catrina's voice returned an inaudible answer, and not
wishing any<br>
longer to play the eavesdropper, I continued my path towards the
stable.<br>
The distant noises from the city announced a state of movement
and<br>
preparation, and more than one orderly passed the road near me at
a gallop.<br>
As I turned into the wide courtyard, Mike, breathless and
flurried with<br>
running, overtook me.</p>

<p>"Are the horses ready, Mike?" said I; "we must start this
instant?"</p>

<p>"They've just finished a peck of oats apiece, and faix, that
same may be a<br>
stranger to them this day six months."</p>

<p>"And the baggage, too?"</p>

<p>"On the cars, with the staff and the light brigade. It was
down there I was<br>
now, to see all was right."</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm quite aware; and now bring out the cattle. I hope
Catrina received<br>
your little consolations well. That seems a very sad affair."</p>

<p>"Murder, real murder, devil a less! It's no matter where you
go, from<br>
Clonmel to Chayney, it's all one; they've a way of getting round
you. Upon<br>
my soul, it's like the pigs they are."</p>

<p>"Like pigs, Mike? That appears a strange compliment you've
selected to pay<br>
them."</p>

<p>"Ay, just like the pigs, no less. May be you've heard what
happened to<br>
myself up at Moronha?"</p>

<p>"Look to that girth there. Well, go on."</p>

<p>"I was coming along one morning, just as day was beginning to
break, when I<br>
sees a slip of a pig trotting before me, with nobody near him;
but as the<br>
road was lonely, and myself rather down in heart, I thought,
Musha! but yer<br>
fine company, anyhow, av a body could only keep you with him.
But, ye see,<br>
a pig&mdash;saving your presence&mdash;is a baste not easily flattered, so
I didn't<br>
waste time and blarney upon him, but I took off my belt, and put
it round<br>
its neck as neat as need be; but, as the devil's luck would have
it, I<br>
didn't go half an hour when a horse came galloping up behind me.
I turned<br>
round, and, by the blessed light, it was Sir Dinny himself was on
it!"</p>

<p>"Sir Dennis Pack?"</p>

<p>"Yes, bad luck to his hook nose. 'What are you doing there, my
fine<br>
fellow?' says he. 'What's that you have dragging there behind
you?'</p>

<p>"'A boneen, sir,' says I. 'Isn't he a fine crayture?&mdash;av he
wasn't so<br>
troublesome.'</p>

<p>"'Troublesome, troublesome&mdash;what do you mean?'</p>

<p>"'Just so,' says I. 'Isn't he parsecutiug the life out of me
the whole<br>
morning, following me about everywhere I go? Contrary bastes they
always<br>
was.'</p>

<p>"'I advise you to try and part company, my friend,
notwithstanding,' says<br>
he; 'or may be it's the same end you'll be coming to, and not
long either.'<br>
And faix, I took his advice; and ye see, Mister Charles, it's
just as I was<br>
saying, they're like the women, the least thing in life is enough
to bring<br>
them after us, <i>av ye only put the 'comether'</i> upon them."</p>

<p>"And now adieu to the Villa Nuova," said I, as I rode slowly
down the<br>
avenue, turning ever and anon in my saddle to look back on each
well-known<br>
spot.</p>

<p>A heavy sigh from Mike responded to my words.</p>

<p>"A long, a last farewell!" said I, waving my hand towards the
trellised<br>
walls, now half-hidden by the trees; and, as I spoke, that
heaviness of the<br>
heart came over me that seems inseparable from leave-taking. The
hour of<br>
parting seems like a warning to us that all our enjoyments and
pleasures<br>
here are destined to a short and merely fleeting existence; and
as each<br>
scene of life passes away never to return, we are made to feel
that youth<br>
and hope are passing with them; and that, although the fair world
be as<br>
bright, and its pleasures as rich in abundance, our capacity of
enjoyment<br>
is daily, hourly diminishing; and while all around us smiles in
beauty and<br>
happiness, that we, alas! are not what we were.</p>

<p>Such was the tenor of my thoughts as I reached the road, when
they were<br>
suddenly interrupted by my man Mike, whose meditations were
following<br>
a somewhat similar channel, though at last inclining to
different<br>
conclusions. He coughed a couple of times as if to attract my
attention,<br>
and then, as it were half thinking aloud, he muttered,&mdash;</p>

<p>"I wonder if we treated the young ladies well, anyhow, Mister
Charles, for,<br>
faix, I've my doubts on it."</p>

<br><br><br><br><p>CHAPTER XIX.</p>

<p>THE LINES.</p>

<p>When we reached Lescas, we found that an officer of Lord
Wellington's staff<br>
had just arrived from the lines, and was occupied in making known
the<br>
general order from headquarters; which set forth, with customary
brevity,<br>
that the French armies, under the command of Massena, had retired
from<br>
their position, and were in full retreat,&mdash;the second and third
corps,<br>
which had been stationed at Villa Franca, having marched, during
the<br>
night of the 15th, in the direction of Manal. The officers in
command of<br>
divisions were ordered to repair instantly to Pero Negro, to
consult upon a<br>
forward movement, Admiral Berkeley being written to to provide
launches to<br>
pass over General Hill's, or any other corps which might be
selected, to<br>
the left bank of the Tagus. All now was excitement, heightened by
the<br>
unexpected nature of an occurrence which not even speculation
had<br>
calculated upon. It was but a few days before, and the news had
reached<br>
Torres Vedras that a powerful reinforcement was in march to join
Massena's<br>
army, and their advanced guard had actually reached Santarem. The
confident<br>
expectation was, therefore, that an attack upon the lines was
meditated.<br>
Now, however, this prospect existed no longer; for scarcely had
the heavy<br>
mists of the lowering day disappeared, when the vast plain, so
lately<br>
peopled by the thickened ranks and dark masses of a great army,
was seen in<br>
its whole extent deserted and untenanted.</p>

<p>The smouldering fires of the pickets alone marked where the
troops had been<br>
posted, but not a man of that immense force was to be seen.
General Fane,<br>
who had been despatched with a brigade of Portuguese cavalry and
some<br>
artillery, hung upon the rear of the retiring army, and from him
we learned<br>
that the enemy were continuing their retreat northward, having
occupied<br>
Santarem with a strong force to cover the movement. Crawfurd was
ordered<br>
to the front with the light division, the whole army following in
the same<br>
direction, except Hill's corps, which, crossing the river at
Velada, was<br>
intended to harass the enemy's flank, and assist our future
operations.</p>

<p>Such, in brief, was the state of affairs when I reached Villa
Franca<br>
towards noon, and received orders to join my regiment, then
forming part of<br>
Sir Stapleton Cotton's brigade.</p>

<p>It must be felt to be thoroughly appreciated, the enthusiastic
pleasure<br>
with which one greets his old corps after some months of
separation: the<br>
bounding ecstasy with which the weary eye rests on the old
familiar faces,<br>
dear by every association of affection and brotherhood; the
anxious look<br>
for this one and for that; the thrill of delight sent through the
heart as<br>
the well-remembered march swells upon the ear; the very notes of
that rough<br>
voice which we have heard amidst the crash of battle and the
rolling of<br>
artillery, speak softly to our senses like a father's welcome;
from the<br>
well-tattered flag that waves above us to the proud steed of the
war-worn<br>
trumpeter, each has a niche in our affection.</p>

<p>If ever there was a corps calculated to increase and foster
these<br>
sentiments, the 14th Light Dragoons was such. The warm affection,
the truly<br>
heart-felt regard, which existed among my brother officers, made
of our<br>
mess a happy home. Our veteran colonel, grown gray in
campaigning, was like<br>
a father to us; while the senior officers, tempering the warm
blood of<br>
impetuous youth with their hard-won experience, threw a charm of
peace and<br>
tranquillity over all our intercourse that made us happy when
together, and<br>
taught us to feel that, whether seated around the watch-fire or
charging<br>
amidst the squadrons of the enemy, we were surrounded by those
devoted<br>
heart and soul to aid us.</p>

<p>Gallant Fourteenth!&mdash;ever first in every gay scheme of
youthful jollity, as<br>
foremost in the van to meet the foe&mdash;how happy am I to recall the
memory<br>
of your bright looks and bold hearts; of your manly daring and
your bold<br>
frankness; of your merry voices, as I have heard them in the
battle or in<br>
the bivouac! Alas and alas, that I should indulge such
recollections alone!<br>
How few&mdash;how very few&mdash;are left of those with whom I trod the
early steps<br>
of life, whose bold cheer I have heard above the clashing sabres
of the<br>
enemy, whose broken voice I have listened to above the grave of a
comrade!<br>
The dark pines of the Pyrenees wave above some, the burning sands
of India<br>
cover others, and the wide plains of Salamanca are the
abiding-place of<br>
still more.</p>

<p>"Here comes O'Malley!" shouted a well-known voice, as I rode
down the<br>
little slope at the foot of which a group of officers were
standing beside<br>
their horses.</p>

<p>"Welcome, thou man of Galway!" cried Hampden; "delighted to
have you once<br>
more among us. How confoundedly well the fellow is looking!"</p>

<p>"Lisbon beef seems better prog than commissariat biscuit!"
said another.</p>

<p>"A'weel, Charley?" said my friend the Scotch doctor; "how's a'
wi' ye man?<br>
Ye seem to thrive on your mishaps! How cam' ye by that braw
beastie ye're<br>
mounted on?"</p>

<p>"A present, Doctor; the gift of a very warm friend."</p>

<p>"I hope you invited him to the mess, O'Malley! For, by Jove,
our stables<br>
stand in need of his kind offices! There he goes! Look at him!
What a<br>
slashing pace for a heavy fellow!" This observation was made
with<br>
reference to a well-known officer on the commander-in-chief's
staff, whose<br>
weight&mdash;some two and twenty stone&mdash;never was any impediment to
his bold<br>
riding.</p>

<p>"Egad, O'Malley, you'll soon be as pretty a light-weight as
our friend<br>
yonder. Ah, there's a storm going on there! Here comes the
colonel!"</p>

<p>"Well, O'Malley, are you come back to us? Happy to see you,
boy! Hope<br>
we shall not lose you again in a hurry! We can't spare the
scapegraces!<br>
There's plenty of skirmishing going on! Crawfurd always asks for
the<br>
scapegraces for the pickets!"</p>

<p>I shook my gallant colonel's hand, while I acknowledged, as
best I might,<br>
his ambiguous compliment.</p>

<p>"I say, lads," resumed the colonel, "squad your men and form
on the road!<br>
Lord Wellington's coming down this way to have a look at you!
O'Malley, I<br>
have General Crawfurd's orders to offer you your old appointment
on his<br>
staff; without you prefer to remaining with the regiment!"</p>

<p>"I can never be sufficiently grateful, sir, to the general:
but, in fact&mdash;I<br>
think&mdash;that is, I believe&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You'd rather be among your own fellows. Out with it boy! I
like you all<br>
the better! But come, we mustn't let the general know that; so
that I shall<br>
forget to tell you all about it. Eh, isn't that best? But join
your troop<br>
now; I hear the staff coming this way."</p>

<p>As he spoke, a crowd of horseman were seen advancing towards
us at a sharp<br>
trot, their waving plumes and gorgeous aiguillettes denoting
their rank<br>
as generals of division. In the midst, as they came nearer, I
could<br>
distinguish one whom once seen there was no forgetting; his plain
blue<br>
frock and gray trousers, unstrapped beneath his boots, not a
little unlike<br>
the trim accuracy of costume around him. As he rode to the head
of the<br>
leading squadron, the staff fell back and he stood alone before
us; for a<br>
second there was a dead silence, but the next instant&mdash;by what
impulse tell<br>
who can&mdash;one tremendous cheer burst from the entire regiment. It
was like<br>
the act of one man; so sudden, so spontaneous. While every cheek
glowed,<br>
and every eye sparkled with enthusiasm, he alone seemed cool and
unexcited,<br>
as, gently raising his hand, he motioned them to silence.</p>

<p>"Fourteenth, you are to be where you always desire to be,&mdash;in
the advanced<br>
guard of the army. I have nothing to say on the subject of your
conduct<br>
in the field. I know <i>you</i>; but if in pursuit of the enemy, I
hear of any<br>
misconduct towards the people of the country, or any
transgression of the<br>
general orders regarding pillage, by G&mdash;&mdash;, I'll punish you as
severely as<br>
the worst corps in the service, and you know <i>me!</i>"</p>

<p>"Oh, tear an ages, listen to that; and there's to be no
plunder after all!"<br>
said Mickey Free; and for an instant the most I could do was not
to burst<br>
into a fit of laughter. The word, "Forward!" was given at the
moment, and<br>
we moved past in close column, while that penetrating eye, which
seemed to<br>
read our very thoughts, scanned us from one end of the line to
the other.</p>

<p>"I say, Charley," said the captain of my troop, in a
whisper,&mdash;"I say, that<br>
confounded cheer we gave got us that lesson; he can't stand that
kind of<br>
thing."</p>

<p>"By Jove! I never felt more disposed than to repeat it," said
I.</p>

<p>"No, no, my boy, we'll give him the honors, nine times nine;
but wait till<br>
evening. Look at old Merivale there. I'll swear he's saying
something<br>
devilish civil to him. Do you see the old fellow's happy
look?"</p>

<p>And so it was; the bronzed, hard-cast features of the veteran
soldier<br>
were softened into an expression of almost boyish delight, as he
sat,<br>
bare-headed, bowing to his very saddle, while Lord Wellington was
speaking.</p>

<p>As I looked, my heart throbbed painfully against my side, my
breath came<br>
quick, and I muttered to myself, "What would I not give to be in
his place<br>
now!"</p>

<br><br><br><br><p>CHAPTER XX.</p>

<p>THE RETREAT OF THE FRENCH.</p>

<p>It is not my intention, were I even adequate to the task, to
trace with<br>
anything like accuracy the events of the war at this period. In
fact, to<br>
those who, like myself, were performing a mere subaltern
character, the<br>
daily movements of our own troops, not to speak of the continual
changes<br>
of the enemy, were perfectly unknown, and an English newspaper
was more<br>
ardently longed for in the Peninsula than by the most eager crowd
of a<br>
London coffee-room; nay, the results of the very engagements we
were<br>
ourselves concerned in, more than once, first reached us through
the press<br>
of our own country. It is easy enough to understand this. The
officer in<br>
command of the regiment, and how much more, the captain of a
troop, or the<br>
subaltern under him, knows nothing beyond the sphere of his own
immediate<br>
duty; by the success or failure of his own party his knowledge is
bounded,<br>
but how far he or his may influence the fortune, of the day, or
of what is<br>
taking place elsewhere, he is totally ignorant; and an old
Fourteenth man<br>
did not badly explain, his ideas on the matter, who described
Busaco as "a<br>
great noise and a great smoke, booming artillery and rattling
small-arms,<br>
infernal confusion, and to all seeming, incessant blundering,
orders<br>
and counter-orders, ending with a crushing charge; when, not
being hurt<br>
himself, nor having hurt anybody, he felt much pleased to learn
that they<br>
had gained a victory." It is then sufficient for all the purposes
of my<br>
narrative, when I mention that Massena continued his retreat by
Santarem<br>
and Thomar, followed by the allied army, who, however desirous of
pressing<br>
upon the rear of their enemy, were still obliged to maintain
their<br>
communication with the lines, and also to watch the movement of
the large<br>
armies which, under Ney and Soult, threatened at any unguarded
moment to<br>
attack them in flank.</p>

<p>The position which Massena occupied at Santarem, naturally one
of great<br>
strength, and further improved by intrenchments, defied any
attack on<br>
the part of Lord Wellington, until the arrival of the
long-expected<br>
reinforcements from England. These had sailed in the early part
of January,<br>
but delayed by adverse winds, only reached Lisbon on the 2d of
March; and<br>
so correctly was the French marshal apprised of the circumstance,
and so<br>
accurately did he anticipate the probable result, that on the
fourth he<br>
broke up his encampment, and recommenced his retrograde movement,
with an<br>
army now reduced to forty thousand fighting men, and with two
thousand<br>
sick, destroying all his baggage and guns that could not be
horsed. By a<br>
demonstration of advancing upon the Zezere, by which he held the
allies<br>
in check, he succeeded in passing his wounded to the rear, while
Ney,<br>
appearing with a large force suddenly at Leiria, seemed bent upon
attacking<br>
the lines. By these stratagems two days' march were gained, and
the French<br>
retreated upon Torres Novas and Thomar, destroying the bridges
behind them<br>
as they passed.</p>

<p>The day was breaking on the 12th of March, when the British
first came in<br>
sight of the retiring enemy. We were then ordered to the front,
and broken<br>
up into small parties, threw out our skirmishers. The French
chasseurs,<br>
usually not indisposed to accept this species of encounter,
showed now less<br>
of inclination than usual, and either retreated before us, or
hovered in<br>
masses to check our advance; in this way the morning was passed,
when<br>
towards noon we perceived that the enemy was drawn up in battle
array,<br>
occupying the height above the village of Redinha. This little
straggling<br>
village is situated in a hollow traversed by a narrow causeway
which opens<br>
by a long and dangerous defile upon a bridge, on either side of
which a<br>
dense wood afforded a shelter for light troops, while upon the
commanding<br>
eminence above a battery of heavy guns was seen in position.</p>

<p>In front of the village a brigade of artillery and a division
of infantry<br>
were drawn up so skilfully as to give the appearance of a
considerable<br>
force, so that when Lord Wellington came up he spent some time in
examining<br>
the enemy's position. Erskine's brigade was immediately ordered
up, and the<br>
Fifty-second and Ninety-fourth, and a company of the Forty-third
were led<br>
against the wooded slopes upon the French right. Picton
simultaneously<br>
attacked the left, and in less than an hour, both were
successful, and<br>
Ney's position was laid bare; his skirmishers, however, continued
to hold<br>
their ground in front, and La Ferri&egrave;re, a colonel of
hussars, dashing<br>
boldly forward at this very moment, carried off fourteen
prisoners from<br>
the very front of our line. Deceived by the confidence of the
enemy, Lord<br>
Wellington now prepared for an attack in force. The infantry were
therefore<br>
formed into line, and, at the signal of three shots fired from
the centre,<br>
began their foremost movement.</p>

<p>Bending up a gentle curve, the whole plain glistened with the
glancing<br>
bayonets, and the troops marched majestically onward; while the
light<br>
artillery and the cavalry, bounding forward from the left and
centre,<br>
rushed eagerly towards the foe. One deafening discharge from the
French<br>
guns opened at the moment, with a general volley of small-arms.
The smoke<br>
for an instant obscured everything, and when that cleared away,
no enemy<br>
was to be seen.</p>

<p>The British pressed madly on, like heated blood-hounds; but
when they<br>
descended the slope, the village of Redinha was in flames, and
the French<br>
in full retreat beyond it. A single howitzer seemed our only
trophy, and<br>
even this we were not destined to boast of, for from the midst of
the<br>
crashing flame and dense smoke of the burning village, a troop of
dragoons<br>
rushed forward, and charging our infantry, carried it off. The
struggle,<br>
though but for a moment, cost them dear: twenty of their comrades
lay dead<br>
upon the spot; but they were resolute and determined, and the
officer who<br>
led them on, fighting hand to hand with a soldier of the
Forty-second,<br>
cheered them as they retired. His gallant bearing, and his coat
covered<br>
with decorations, bespoke him one of note, and well it might; he
who<br>
thus perilled his life to maintain the courage of his soldiers at
the<br>
commencement of a retreat, was none other than Ney himself, <i>le
plus brave<br>
des braves</i>. The British pressed hotly on, and the light troops
crossed the<br>
river almost at the same time with the French. Ney, however, fell
back upon<br>
Condeixa, where his main body was posted, and all farther pursuit
was for<br>
the present abandoned.</p>

<p>At Casa Noval and at Foz d'Aronce, the allies were successful;
but the<br>
French still continued to retire, burning the towns and villages
in their<br>
rear, and devastating the country along the whole line of march
by every<br>
expedient of cruelty the heart of man has ever conceived. In the
words of<br>
one whose descriptions, however fraught with the most wonderful
power of<br>
painting, are equally marked by truth, "Every horror that could
make war<br>
hideous attended this dreadful march. Distress, conflagration,
death in<br>
all modes,&mdash;from wounds, from fatigue, from water, from the
flames, from<br>
starvation,&mdash;vengeance, unlimited vengeance, was on every side."
The<br>
country was a desert!</p>

<p>Such was the exhaustion of the allies, who suffered even
greater privations<br>
than the enemy, that they halted upon the 16th, unable to proceed
farther;<br>
and the river Ceira, swollen and unfordable, flowed between the
rival<br>
armies.</p>

<p>The repose of even one day was a most grateful interruption to
the<br>
harassing career we had pursued for some time past; and it seemed
that my<br>
comrades felt, like myself, that such an opportunity was by no
means to<br>
be neglected; but while I am devoting so much space and
trespassing on my<br>
reader's patience thus far with narrative of flood and field, let
me steal<br>
a chapter for what will sometimes seem a scarcely less congenial
topic, and<br>
bring back the recollection of a glorious night in the
Peninsula.</p>

<br><br><br><br><p>CHAPTER XXI.</p>

<p>PATRICK'S DAY IN THE PENINSULA.</p>

<p>The <i>r&eacute;veil</i> had not yet sounded, when I felt my
shoulder shaken gently as<br>
I lay wrapped up in my cloak beneath a prickly pear-tree.</p>

<p>"Lieutenant O'Malley, sir; a letter, sir; a bit of a note,
your honor,"<br>
said a voice that bespoke the bearer and myself were countrymen.
I opened<br>
it, and with difficulty, by the uncertain light, read as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>    Dear Charley,&mdash;As Lord Wellington, like a good Irishman
as<br>
    he is, wouldn't spoil Patrick's Day by marching, we've got a
little<br>
    dinner at our quarters to celebrate the holy times, as my
uncle would<br>
    call it. Maurice, Phil Grady, and some regular trumps will
all come,<br>
    so don't disappoint us. I've been making punch all night,
and<br>
    Casey, who has a knack at pastry, has made a goose-pie as big
as a<br>
    portmanteau. Sharp seven, after parade. The second battalion
of<br>
    the Fusiliers are quartered at Melant&eacute;, and we are
next them. Bring<br>
    any of yours worth their liquor. Power is, I know, absent
with the<br>
    staff; perhaps the Scotch doctor would come; try him. Carry
over<br>
    a little mustard with you, if there be such in your
parts.</p>

<p>    Yours,</p>

<p>    D. O'SHAUGHNESSY.</p>

<p>    Patrick's day, and raining like blazes.</p>

<p>Seeing that the bearer expected an answer, I scrawled the
words, "I'm<br>
there," with my pencil on the back of the note, and again turned
myself<br>
round to sleep. My slumbers were, however, soon interrupted once
more; for<br>
the bugles of the light infantry and the hoarse trumpet of the
cavalry<br>
sounded the call, and I found to my surprise that, though halted,
we were<br>
by no means destined to a day of idleness. Dragoons were already
mounted,<br>
carrying orders hither and thither, and staff-officers were
galloping right<br>
and left. A general order commanded an inspection of the troops,
and within<br>
less than an hour from daybreak the whole army was drawn up under
arms. A<br>
thin, drizzling rain continued to fall during the early part of
the day,<br>
but the sun gradually dispelled the heavy vapor; and as the
bright verdure<br>
glittered in its beams, sending up all the perfumes of a southern
clime, I<br>
thought I had never seen a more lovely morning. The staff were
stationed<br>
upon a little knoll beside the river, round the base of which the
troops<br>
defiled, at first in orderly, then in quick time, the bands
playing and the<br>
colors flying. In the same brigade with us the Eighty-eighth
came, and as<br>
they neared the commander-in-chief, their quick-step was suddenly
stopped,<br>
and after a pause of a few seconds, the band struck up "St.
Patrick's Day;"<br>
the notes were caught up by the other Irish regiments, and amidst
one<br>
prolonged cheer from the whole line, the gallant fellows moved
past.</p>

<p>The grenadier company were drawn up beside the road, and I was
not long in<br>
detecting my friend O'Shaughnessy, who wore a tremendous shamrock
in his<br>
shako.</p>

<p>"Left face, wheel! Quick march! Don't forget the mustard!"
said the bold<br>
major; and a loud roar of laughing from my brother officers
followed him<br>
off the ground. I soon explained the injunction, and having
invited some<br>
three or four to accompany me to the dinner, waited with all
patience for<br>
the conclusion of the parade.</p>

<p>The sun was setting as I mounted, and joined by Hampden,
Baker, the doctor,<br>
and another, set out for O'Shaughnessy's quarters. As we rode
along, we<br>
were continually falling in with others bent upon the same errand
as<br>
ourselves, and ere we arrived at Melant&eacute; our party was
some thirty strong;<br>
and truly a most extraordinary procession did we form. Few of
the<br>
invited came without some contribution to the general stock; and
while a<br>
staff-officer flourished a ham, a smart hussar might be seen with
a plucked<br>
turkey, trussed for roasting; most carried bottles, as the
consumption of<br>
fluid was likely to be considerable; and one fat old major jogged
along on<br>
a broken-winded pony, with a basket of potatoes on his arm. Good
fellowship<br>
was the order of the day, and certainly a more jovial squadron
seldom was<br>
met together than ours. As we turned the angle of a rising
ground, a hearty<br>
cheer greeted us, and we beheld in front of an old ordnance
marquee a party<br>
of some fifty fellows engaged in all the pleasing duties of the
<i>cuisine</i>.<br>
Maurice, conspicuous above all, with a white apron and a ladle in
his hand,<br>
was running hither and thither, advising, admonishing,
instructing, and<br>
occasionally imprecating. Ceasing for a second his functions, he
gave us a<br>
cheer and a yell like that of an Indian savage, and then resumed
his duties<br>
beside a huge boiler, which, from the frequency of his
explorations into<br>
its contents, we judged to be punch.</p>

<p>"Charley, my son, I've a place for you; don't forget. Where's
my learned<br>
brother?&mdash;haven't you brought him with you? Ah, Doctor, how goes
it?"</p>

<a name="0158"></a>
<img alt="0158.jpg (139K)" src="0158.jpg" height="505" width="811">

<p>[GOING OUT TO DINNER.]</p>
<br><br>
<p>"Nae that bad, Master Quell: a' things considered, we've had
an awfu' time<br>
of it lately."</p>

<p>"You know my friend Hampden, Maurice. Let me introduce Mr.
Baker, Mr.<br>
Maurice Quill. Where's the major?"</p>

<p>"Here I am, my darling, and delighted to see you. Some of
yours, O'Malley,<br>
ain't they? Proud to have you, gentlemen. Charley, we are obliged
to have<br>
several tables; but you are to be beside Maurice, so take your
friends with<br>
you. There goes the 'Roast Beef;' my heart warms to that old
tune."</p>

<p>Amidst a hurried recognition, and shaking of hands on every
side, I elbowed<br>
my way into the tent, and soon reached a corner, where, at a
table for<br>
eight, I found Maurice seated at one end; a huge, purple-faced
old major,<br>
whom he presented to us as Bob Mahon, occupied the other.
O'Shaughnessy<br>
presided at the table next to us, but near enough to join in all
the<br>
conviviality of ours.</p>

<p>One must have lived for some months upon hard biscuit and
harder beef<br>
to relish as we did the fare before us, and to form an estimate
of our<br>
satisfaction. If the reader cannot fancy Van Amburgh's lions in
red coats<br>
and epaulettes, he must be content to lose the effect of the
picture. A<br>
turkey rarely fed more than two people, and few were abstemious
enough to<br>
be satisfied with one chicken. The order of the viands, too,
observed no<br>
common routine, each party being happy to get what he could, and
satisfied<br>
to follow up his pudding with fish, or his tart with a sausage.
Sherry,<br>
champagne, London porter, Malaga, and even, I believe, Harvey's
sauce were<br>
hobnobbed in; while hot punch, in teacups or tin vessels, was
unsparingly<br>
distributed on all sides. Achilles himself, they say, got tired
of eating,<br>
and though he consumed something like a prize ox to his own
cheek, he at<br>
length had to call for cheese, so that we at last gave in, and
having<br>
cleared away the broken tumbrels and baggage-carts of our army,
cleared for<br>
a general action.</p>

<p>"Now, lads!" cried the major, "I'm not going to lose your time
and mine by<br>
speaking; but there are a couple of toasts I must insist upon
your drinking<br>
with all the honors; and as I like despatch, we'll couple them.
It so<br>
happens that our old island boasts of two of the finest fellows
that<br>
ever wore Russia ducks. None of your nonsensical geniuses, like
poets or<br>
painters or anything like that; but downright, straightforward,
no-humbug<br>
sort of devil-may-care and bad-luck-to-you kind of chaps,&mdash;real
Irishmen!<br>
Now, it's a strange thing that they both had such an antipathy to
vermin,<br>
they spent their life in hunting them down and destroying them;
and whether<br>
they met toads at home or Johnny Crapaud abroad, it was all one.
[Cheers.]<br>
Just so, boys; they made them leave that; but I see you are
impatient, so<br>
I'll not delay you, but fill to the brim, and with the best cheer
in your<br>
body, drink with me the two greatest Irishmen that ever lived,
'Saint<br>
Patrick and Lord Wellington.'"</p>

<p>The Englishmen laughed long and loud, while we cheered with an
energy that<br>
satisfied even the major.</p>

<p>"Who is to give us the chant? Who is to sing Saint Patrick?"
cried Maurice.<br>
"Come, Bob, out with it."</p>

<p>"I'm four tumblers too low for that yet," growled out the
major.</p>

<p>"Well, then, Charley, be you the man; or why not Dennis
himself? Come,<br>
Dennis, we cannot better begin our evening than with a song; let
us have<br>
our old friend 'Larry M'Hale.'"</p>

<p>"Larry M'Hale!" resounded from all parts of the room, while
O'Shaughnessy<br>
rose once more to his legs.</p>

<p>"Faith, boys, I'm always ready to follow your lead; but what
analogy can<br>
exist between 'Larry M'Hale' and the toast we have just drank I
can't see<br>
for the life of me; not but Larry would have made a strapping
light company<br>
man had he joined the army."</p>

<p>"The song, the song!" cried several voices.</p>

<p>"Well, if you will have it, here goes:"&mdash;</p>

<p>    LARRY M'HALE.</p>

<p>    AIR,&mdash;<i>"It's a bit of a thing</i>," <i>etc</i>.</p>

<p>    Oh, Larry M'Hale he had little to fear,<br>
    And never could want when the crops didn't fail;<br>
    He'd a house and demesne and eight hundred a year,<br>
    And the heart for to spend it, had Larry M'Hale!<br>
    The soul of a party, the life of a feast,<br>
    And an illigant song he could sing, I'll be bail;<br>
    He would ride with the rector, and drink with the priest,<br>
    Oh, the broth of a boy was old Larry M'Hale!</p>

<p>    It's little he cared for the judge or recorder,<br>
    His house was as big and as strong as a jail;<br>
    With a cruel four-pounder, he kept in great order,<br>
    He'd murder the country, would Larry M'Hale.<br>
    He'd a blunderbuss too, of horse-pistols a pair;<br>
    But his favorite weapon was always a flail.<br>
    I wish you could see how he'd empty a fair,<br>
    For he handled it neatly, did Larry M'Hale.</p>

<p>    His ancestors were kings before Moses was born,<br>
    His mother descended from great Grana Uaile;<br>
    He laughed all the Blakes and the Frenches to scorn;<br>
    They were mushrooms compared to old Larry M'Hale.<br>
    He sat down every day to a beautiful dinner,<br>
    With cousins and uncles enough for a tail;<br>
    And, though loaded with debt, oh, the devil a thinner,<br>
    Could law or the sheriff make Larry M'Hale!</p>

<p>    With a larder supplied and a cellar well stored,<br>
    None lived half so well, from Fair-Head to Kinsale,<br>
    As he piously said, "I've a plentiful board,<br>
    And the Lord he is good to old Larry M'Hale."<br>
    So fill up your glass, and a high bumper give him,<br>
    It's little we'd care for the tithes or repale;<br>
    For ould Erin would be a fine country to live in,<br>
    If we only had plenty like LARRY M'HALE.</p>

<p>"Very singular style of person your friend Mr. M'Hale," lisped
a<br>
spooney-looking cornet at the end of the table.</p>

<p>"Not in the country he belongs to, I assure you," said
Maurice; "but I<br>
presume you were never in Ireland."</p>

<p>"You are mistaken there," resumed the other; "I was in
Ireland, though I<br>
confess not for a long time."</p>

<p>"If I might be so bold," cried Maurice, "how long?"</p>

<p>"Half an hour, by a stop-watch," said the other, pulling up
his stock; "and<br>
I had quite enough of it in that time."</p>

<p>"Pray give us your experiences," cried out Bob Mahon; "they
should be<br>
interesting, considering your opportunities."</p>

<p>"You are right," said the cornet; "they were so; and as they
illustrate a<br>
feature in your amiable country, you shall have them."</p>

<p>A general knocking upon the table announced the impatience of
the company,<br>
and when silence was restored the cornet began:&mdash;</p>

<p>When the 'Bermuda' transport sailed from Portsmouth for
Lisbon, I happened<br>
to make one of some four hundred interesting individuals who,
before they<br>
became food for powder, were destined to try their constitutions
on pickled<br>
pork. The second day after our sailing, the winds became adverse;
it blew<br>
a hurricane from every corner of the compass but the one it
ought, and the<br>
good ship, that should have been standing straight for the Bay of
Biscay,<br>
was scudding away under a double-reefed topsail towards the coast
of<br>
Labrador. For six days we experienced every sea-manoeuvre that
usually<br>
preludes a shipwreck, and at length, when, what from sea-sickness
and fear,<br>
we had become utterly indifferent to the result, the storm
abated, the sea<br>
went down, and we found ourselves lying comfortably in the harbor
of Cork,<br>
with a strange suspicion on our minds that the frightful scenes
of the past<br>
week had been nothing but a dream.</p>

<p>"'Come, Mr. Medlicot,' said the skipper to me, 'we shall be
here for a<br>
couple of days to refit; had you not better go ashore and see the
country?'</p>

<p>"I sprang to my legs with delight; visions of cowslips, larks,
daisies, and<br>
mutton-chops floated before my excited imagination, and in ten
minutes I<br>
found myself standing at that pleasant little inn at Cove which,
opposite<br>
Spike Island, rejoices in the name of the 'Goat and Garters.'</p>

<p>"'Breakfast, waiter,' said I; 'a beefsteak,&mdash;fresh beef, mark
ye,&mdash;fresh<br>
eggs, bread, milk, and butter, all fresh. No more hard tack,'
thought I;<br>
'no salt butter, but a genuine land breakfast.'</p>

<p>"Up-stairs, No. 4, sir,' said the waiter, as he flourished a
dirty napkin,<br>
indicating the way.</p>

<p>"Up-stairs I went, and in due time the appetizing little meal
made its<br>
appearance. Never did a minor's eye revel over his broad acres
with more<br>
complacent enjoyment than did mine skim over the mutton and the
muffin,<br>
the tea-pot, the trout, and the devilled kidney, so invitingly
spread out<br>
before me. 'Yes,' thought I, as I smacked my lips, 'this is the
reward of<br>
virtue; pickled pork is a probationary state that admirably fits
us for<br>
future enjoyments.' I arranged my napkin upon my knee, seized my
knife<br>
and fork, and proceeded with most critical acumen to bisect a
beefsteak.<br>
Scarcely, however, had I touched it, when, with a loud crash, the
plate<br>
smashed beneath it, and the gravy ran piteously across the cloth.
Before I<br>
had time to account for the phenomenon, the door opened hastily,
and the<br>
waiter rushed into the room, his face beaming with smiles, while
he rubbed<br>
his hands in an ecstasy of delight.</p>

<p>"'It's all over, sir,' said he; 'glory be to God! it's all
done.'</p>

<p>"'What's over? What's done?' inquired I, with impatience.</p>

<p>"'Mr. M'Mahon is satisfied,' replied he, 'and so is the other
gentleman.'</p>

<p>"'Who and what the devil do you mean?'</p>

<p>

[DISADVANTAGE OF BREAKFASTING OVER A
DUELLING-PARTY.]</p>
<br><br>

<p>"'It's over, sir, I say,' replied the waiter again; 'he fired
in the air.'</p>

<p>"'Fired in the air! Was there a duel in the room below
stairs?'</p>

<p>"'Yes, sir,' said the waiter, with a benign smile.</p>

<p>"'That will do,' said I, as seizing my hat, I rushed out of
the house, and<br>
hurrying to the beach, took a boat for the ship. Exactly half an
hour had<br>
elapsed since my landing, but even those short thirty minutes had
fully as<br>
many reasons that although there may be few more amusing, there
are some<br>
safer places to live in than the Green Isle."</p>

<p>A general burst of laughter followed the cornet's story, which
was<br>
heightened in its effect by the gravity with which he told
it.</p>

<p>"And after all," said Maurice Quill, "now that people have
given up making<br>
fortunes for the insurance companies by living to the age of
Methuselah,<br>
there's nothing like being an Irishman. In what other part of the
habitable<br>
globe can you cram so much adventure into one year? Where can you
be so<br>
often in love, in liquor, or in debt; and where can you get so
merrily out<br>
of the three? Where are promises to marry and promises to pay
treated with<br>
the same gentleman-like forbearance; and where, when you have
lost your<br>
heart and your fortune, are people found so ready to comfort you
in your<br>
reverses? Yes," said Maurice, as he filled his glass up to the
brim, and<br>
eyed it lusciously for a moment,&mdash;"yes, darling, here's your
health; the<br>
only girl I ever loved&mdash;in that part of the country, I mean. Give
her a<br>
bumper, lads, and I'll give you a chant."</p>

<p>"Name! name! name!" shouted several voices from different
parts of the<br>
table.</p>

<p>"Mary Draper!" said Maurice, filling his glass once more,
while the name<br>
was re-echoed by every lip at table.</p>

<p>"The song! the song!"</p>

<p>"Faith, I hope I haven't forgotten it," quoth Maurice. "No;
here it is."</p>

<p>So saying, after a couple of efforts to assure the pitch of
his voice, the<br>
worthy doctor began the following words to that very popular
melody, "Nancy<br>
Dawson:"&mdash;</p>

<p>    MARY DRAPER.</p>

<p>    AIR,&mdash;<i>Nancy Dawson</i>.</p>

<p>    Don't talk to me of London dames,<br>
    Nor rave about your foreign flames,<br>
    That never lived, except in drames,<br>
    Nor shone, except on paper;<br>
    I'll sing you 'bout a girl I knew,<br>
    Who lived in Ballywhacmacrew,<br>
    And let me tell you, mighty few<br>
    Could equal Mary Draper.</p>

<p>    Her cheeks were red, her eyes were blue,<br>
    Her hair was brown of deepest hue,<br>
    Her foot was small, and neat to view,<br>
    Her waist was slight and taper;<br>
    Her voice was music to your ear,<br>
    A lovely brogue, so rich and clear,<br>
    Oh, the like I ne'er again shall hear,<br>
    As from sweet Mary Draper.</p>

<p>    She'd ride a wall, she'd drive a team,<br>
    Or with a fly she'd whip a stream,<br>
    Or may be sing you "Rousseau's Dream,"<br>
    For nothing could escape her;<br>
    I've seen her, too,&mdash;upon my word,&mdash;<br>
    At sixty yards bring down her bird,<br>
    Oh, she charmed all the Forty-third,<br>
    Did lovely Mary Draper.</p>

<p>    And at the spring assizes' ball,<br>
    The junior bar would one and all<br>
    For all her fav'rite dances call,<br>
    And Harry Dean would caper;<br>
    Lord Clare would then forget his lore;<br>
    King's Counsel, voting law a bore,<br>
    Were proud to figure on the floor,<br>
    For love of Mary Draper.</p>

<p>    The parson, priest, sub-sheriff too,<br>
    Were all her slaves, and so would you,<br>
    If you had only but one view,<br>
    Of such a face and shape, or<br>
    Her pretty ankles&mdash;But, ohone,<br>
    It's only west of old Athlone<br>
    Such girls were found&mdash;and now they're gone&mdash;<br>
    So here's to Mary Draper!</p>

<p>"So here's to Mary Draper!" sang out every voice, in such
efforts to catch<br>
the tune as pleased the taste of the motley assembly.</p>

<p>"For Mary Draper and Co., I thank you," said Maurice. "Quill
drinks to<br>
Dennis," added he, in a grave tone, as he nodded to
O'Shaughnessy. "Yes,<br>
Shaugh, few men better than ourselves know these matters; and few
have had<br>
more experience of the three perils of Irishmen,&mdash;love, liquor,
and the law<br>
of arrest."</p>

<p>"It's little the latter has ever troubled my father's son,"
replied<br>
O'Shaughnessy. "Our family have been writ proof for centuries,
and he'd<br>
have been a bold man who would have ventured with an original or
a true<br>
copy within the precincts of Killinahoula."</p>

<p>"Your father had a touch of Larry M'Hale in him," said I,
"apparently."</p>

<p>"Exactly so," replied Dennis; "not but they caught him at
last, and a<br>
scurvy trick it was and well worthy of him who did it! Yes," said
he, with<br>
a sigh, "it is only another among the many instances where the
better<br>
features of our nationality have been used by our enemies as
instruments<br>
for our destruction; and should we seek for the causes of
unhappiness in<br>
our wretched country, we should find them rather in our virtues
than in<br>
our vices, and in the bright rather than in the darker phases of
our<br>
character."</p>

<p>"Metaphysics, by Jove!" cried Quill; "but all true at the same
time. There<br>
was a mess-mate of mine in the 'Roscommon' who never paid
car-hire in his<br>
life. 'Head or harp, Paddy!' he would cry. 'Two tenpennies or
nothing.'<br>
'Harp, for the honor of ould Ireland!' was the invariable
response, and my<br>
friend was equally sure to make head come uppermost; and, upon my
soul,<br>
they seem to know the trick at the Home Office."</p>

<p>"That must have been the same fellow that took my father,"
cried<br>
O'Shaughnessy, with energy.</p>

<p>"Let us hear the story, Dennis," said I.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Maurice, "for the benefit of self and fellows, let
us hear the<br>
stratagem!"</p>

<p>"The way of it was this," resumed O'Shaughnessy. "My father,
who for<br>
reasons registered in the King's Bench spent a great many years
of his life<br>
in that part of Ireland geographically known as lying west of the
law,<br>
was obliged, for certain reasons of family, to come up to Dublin.
This he<br>
proceeded to do with due caution. Two trusty servants formed an
advance<br>
guard, and patrolled the country for at least five miles in
advance; after<br>
them came a skirmishing body of a few tenants, who, for the
consideration<br>
of never paying rent, would have charged the whole Court of
Chancery, if<br>
needful. My father himself, in an old chaise victualled like a
fortress,<br>
brought up the rear; and as I said before, he were a bold man who
would<br>
have attempted to have laid siege to him. As the column advanced
into the<br>
enemy's country, they assumed a closer order, the patrol and the
picket<br>
falling back upon the main body; and in this way they reached
that most<br>
interesting city called Kilbeggan. What a fortunate thing it is
for us in<br>
Ireland that we can see so much of the world without foreign
travel, and<br>
that any gentleman for six-and-eightpence can leave Dublin in the
morning,<br>
and visit Timbuctoo against dinner-time. Don't stare! it's truth
I'm<br>
telling; for dirt, misery, smoke, unaffected behavior, and black
faces,<br>
I'll back Kilbeggan against all Africa. Free-and-easy, pleasant
people ye<br>
are, with a skin, as begrimed and as rugged as your own potatoes!
But, to<br>
resume. The sun was just rising in a delicious morning of June,
when my<br>
father,&mdash;whose loyal antipathies I have mentioned made him also
an early<br>
riser,&mdash;was preparing for the road. A stout escort of his
followers were<br>
as usual under arms to see him safe in the chaise, the passage to
and from<br>
which every day being the critical moment of my father's
life.</p>

<p>"'It's all right, your honor,' said his own man, as, armed
with a<br>
blunderbuss, he opened the bed-room door.</p>

<p>"'Time enough, Tim,' said my father; 'close the door, for I
haven't<br>
finished my breakfast.'</p>

<p>"Now, the real truth was, that my father's attention was at
that moment<br>
withdrawn from his own concerns by a scene which was taking place
in a<br>
field beneath his window.</p>

<p>"But a few minutes before, a hack-chaise had stopped upon the
roadside, out<br>
of which sprang three gentlemen, who, proceeding into the field,
seemed<br>
bent upon something, which, whether a survey or a duel, my father
could not<br>
make out. He was not long, however, to remain in ignorance. One,
with an<br>
easy, lounging gait, strode towards a distant corner; another
took an<br>
opposite direction; while a third, a short, pursy gentleman, in a
red<br>
handkerchief and rabbit-skin waistcoat, proceeded to open a
mahogany<br>
box, which, to the critical eyes of my respected father, was
agreeably<br>
suggestive of bloodshed and murder.</p>

<p>"'A duel, by Jupiter!' said my father, rubbing his hands.
'What a heavenly<br>
morning the scoundrels have,&mdash;not a leaf stirring, and a sod like
a<br>
billiard-table!'</p>

<p>"Meanwhile the little man who officiated as second, it would
appear to<br>
<i>both</i> parties, bustled about with an activity little congenial
to his<br>
shape; and what between snapping the pistols, examining the
flints, and<br>
ramming down the charges, had got himself into a sufficient
perspiration<br>
before he commenced to measure the ground.</p>

<p>"'Short distance and no quarter!' shouted one of the
combatants, from the<br>
corner of the field.</p>

<p>"'Across a handkerchief, if you like!' roared the other.</p>

<p>"'Gentlemen, every inch of them!' responded my father.</p>

<p>"'Twelve paces!' cried the little man. 'No more and no less.
Don't forget<br>
that I am alone in this business!'</p>

<p>"'A very true remark!' observed my father; 'and an awkward
predicament<br>
yours will be if they are not both shot!'</p>

<p>"By this time the combatants had taken their places, and the
little man,<br>
having delivered the pistols, was leisurely retiring to give the
word.<br>
My father, however, whose critical eye was never at fault,
detected a<br>
circumstance which promised an immense advantage to one at the
expense of<br>
the other; in fact, one of the parties was so placed with his
back to the<br>
sun, that his shadow extended in a straight line to the very foot
of his<br>
antagonist.</p>

<p>"'Unfair, unfair!' cried my father, opening the window as he
spoke, and<br>
addressing himself to him of the rabbit-skin. 'I crave your
pardon for the<br>
interruption,' said he; 'but I feel bound to observe that that
gentleman's<br>
shadow is likely to make a shade of him.'</p>

<p>"'And so it is,' observed the short man; 'a thousand thanks
for your<br>
kindness, but the truth is, I am totally unaccustomed to this
kind of<br>
thing, and the affair will not admit of delay.'</p>

<p>"'Not an hour!' said one.</p>

<p>"'No, not five minutes!' growled the other of the
combatants.</p>

<p>"'Put them up north and south,' said my father.</p>

<p>"'Is it thus?'</p>

<p>"'Exactly so. But now, again, the gentleman in the brown coat
is covered<br>
with the ash-tree.'</p>

<p>"'And so he is!' said rabbit-skin, wiping his forehead with
agitation.</p>

<p>"'Move them a little to the left,' said he.</p>

<p>"'That brings me upon an eminence,' said the gentleman in
blue. 'I'll be<br>
d&mdash;d if I be made a cock shot of!'</p>

<p>"'What an awkward little thief it is in the hairy waistcoat!'
said my<br>
father; 'he's lucky if he don't get shot himself!'</p>

<p>"'May I never, if I'm not sick of you both!' ejaculated
rabbit-skin, in a<br>
passion. 'I've moved you round every point of the compass, and
the devil a<br>
nearer we are than ever!'</p>

<p>"'Give us the word,' said one.</p>

<p>"'The word!'</p>

<p>"'Downright murder,' said my father.</p>

<p>"'I don't care,' said the little man; 'we shall be here till
doomsday.'</p>

<p>"'I can't permit this,' said my father; 'allow me.' So saying,
he stepped<br>
upon the window-sill, and leaped down into the field.</p>

<p>"'Before I can accept of your politeness,' said he of the
rabbit-skin, 'may<br>
I beg to know your name and position in society?'</p>

<p>"'Nothing more reasonable,' said my father. 'I'm Miles
O'Shaughnessy,<br>
Colonel of the Royal Raspers,&mdash;here is my card.'</p>

<p>"The piece of pasteboard was complacently handed from one to
the other of<br>
the party, who saluted my father with a smile of most courteous
benignity.</p>

<p>"'Colonel O'Shaughnessy,' said one.</p>

<p>"'Miles O'Shaughnessy,' said the other.</p>

<p>"'Of Killinahoula Castle,' said the third.</p>

<p>"'At your service,' said my father, bowing, as he presented
his snuff-box;<br>
'and now to business, if you please, for my time also is
limited.'</p>

<p>"'Very true,' observed he of the rabbit-skin; 'and, as you
observe, now to<br>
business; in virtue of which, Colonel Miles O'Shaughnessy, I
hereby arrest<br>
you in the King's name. Here is the writ; it's at the suit of
Barnaby<br>
Kelly, of Loughrea, for the sum of &pound;1,482 19s. 7-1/2d.,
which&mdash;'</p>

<p>"Before he could conclude the sentence, my father discharged
one obligation<br>
by implanting his closed knuckles in his face. The blow, well
aimed and<br>
well intentioned, sent the little fellow summersetting like a
sugar<br>
hogshead. But, alas! it was of no use; the others, strong and
able-bodied,<br>
fell both upon him, and after a desperate struggle succeeded in
getting him<br>
down. To tie his hands, and convey him to the chaise, was the
work of a few<br>
moments; and as my father drove by the inn, the last object which
caught<br>
his view was a bloody encounter between his own people and the
myrmidons<br>
of the law, who, in great numbers, had laid siege to the house
during his<br>
capture. Thus was my father taken; and thus, in reward for
yielding to a<br>
virtuous weakness in his character, was he consigned to the
ignominious<br>
durance of a prison. Was I not right, then, in saying that such
is the<br>
melancholy position of our country, the most beautiful traits in
our<br>
character are converted into the elements of our ruin?"</p>

<p>"I dinna think ye ha'e made out your case, Major?" said the
Scotch doctor,<br>
who felt sorely puzzled at my friend's logic. "If your faether
had na gi'en<br>
the bond&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There is no saying what he wouldn't have done to the
bailiffs,"<br>
interrupted Dennis, who was following up a very different train
of<br>
reasoning.</p>

<p>"I fear me, Doctor," observed Quill, "you are much behind us
in Scotland.<br>
Not but that some of your chieftains are respectable men, and
wouldn't get<br>
on badly even in Galway."</p>

<p>"I thank ye muckle for the compliment," said the doctor,
dryly; "but I ha'e<br>
my doubts they'd think it ane, and they're crusty carls that's
no' ower<br>
safe to meddle wi'."</p>

<p>"I'd as soon propose a hand of 'spoiled five' to the Pope of
Rome, as a<br>
joke to one of them," returned Maurice.</p>

<p>"May be ye are na wrang there, Maister Quell."</p>

<p>"Well," cried Hampden, "if I may be allowed an opinion, I can
safely aver I<br>
know no quarters like Scotland. Edinburgh beyond anything or
anywhere I was<br>
ever placed in."</p>

<p>"Always after Dublin," interposed Maurice; while a general
chorus of voices<br>
re-echoed the sentiment.</p>

<p>"You are certainly a strong majority," said my friend,
"against me; but<br>
still I recant not my original opinion. Edinburgh before the
world. For a<br>
hospitality that never tires; for pleasant fellows that improve
every day<br>
of your acquaintance; for pretty girls that make you long for a
repeal of<br>
the canon about being only singly blessed, and lead you to long
for a score<br>
of them, Edinburgh,&mdash;I say again, before the world."</p>

<p>"Their ankles are devilish thick," whispered Maurice.</p>

<p>"A calumny, a base calumny!"</p>

<p>"And then they drink&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes; they drink very strong tea."</p>

<p>"Shall we ha'e a glass o' sherry together, Hampden?" said the
Scotch<br>
doctor, willing to acknowledge his defence of auld Reekie.</p>

<p>"And we'll take O'Malley in," said Hampden; "he looks
imploringly."</p>

<p>"And now to return to the charge," quoth Maurice. "In what
particular dare<br>
ye contend the palm with Dublin? We'll not speak of beauty. I
can't suffer<br>
any such profane turn in the conversation as to dispute the
superiority of<br>
Irishwomen's lips, eyes, noses, and eyebrows, to anything under
heaven.<br>
We'll not talk of gay fellows; egad, we needn't. I'll give you
the<br>
garrison,&mdash;a decent present,&mdash;and I'll back the Irish bar for
more genuine<br>
drollery, more wit, more epigram, more ready sparkling fun, than
the whole<br>
rest of the empire&mdash;ay, and all her colonies&mdash;can boast of."</p>

<p>"They are nae remarkable for passing the bottle, if they
resemble their<br>
very gifted advocate," observed the Scotchman.</p>

<p>"But they are for filling and emptying both, making its
current, as it<br>
glides by, like a rich stream glittering in the sunbeams with the
sparkling<br>
lustre of their wit. Lord, how I'm blown! Fill my pannikin,
Charley.<br>
There's no subduing a Scot. Talk with him, drink with him, fight
with him,<br>
and he'll always have the last of it; there's only one way of
concluding<br>
the treaty&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And that is&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Blarney him. Lord bless you, he can't stand it! Tell him
Holyrood's like<br>
Versailles, and the Trossach's finer than Mont Blanc; that
Geordie Buchanan<br>
was Homer, and the Canongate, Herculaneum,&mdash;then ye have him on
the hip.<br>
Now, ye never can humbug an Irishman that way; he'll know you're
quizzing<br>
him when you praise his country."</p>

<p>"Ye are right, Hampden," said the Scotch doctor, in reply to
some<br>
observation. "We are vara primitive in the Hielands, and we keep
to our ain<br>
national customs in dress and everything; and we are vara slow to
learn,<br>
and even when we try we are nae ower successfu' in our
imitations, which<br>
sometimes cost us dearly enough. Ye may have heard, may be, of
the M'Nab o'<br>
that ilk, and what happened him with the king's equerry?"</p>

<p>"I'm not quite certain," said Hampden, "if I ever heard the
story."</p>

<p>"It's nae muckle of a story; but the way of it was this. When
Montrose came<br>
back from London, he brought with him a few Englishers to show
them the<br>
Highlands, and let them see something of deer-stalking,&mdash;among
the rest, a<br>
certain Sir George Sowerby, an aide-de-camp or an equerry of the
prince.<br>
He was a vara fine gentleman, that never loaded his ain gun, and
a'most<br>
thought it too much trouble to pull the trigger. He went out
every<br>
morning to shoot with his hair curled like a woman, and dressed
like a<br>
dancing-master. Now, there happened to be at the same time at the
castle<br>
the Laird o' M'Nab; he was a kind of cousin of the Montrose, and
a rough<br>
old tyke of the true Hieland breed, wha' thought that the head of
a clan<br>
was fully equal to any king or prince. He sat opposite to Sir
George at<br>
dinner the day of his arrival, and could not conceal his surprise
at the<br>
many new-fangled ways of feeding himself the Englisher adopted.
He ate his<br>
saumon wi' his fork in ae hand, and a bittock of bread in the
other. He<br>
would na touch the whiskey; helped himself to a cutlet wi' his
fingers. But<br>
what was maist extraordinary of all, he wore a pair o' braw white
gloves<br>
during the whole time o' dinner and when they came to tak' away
the cloth,<br>
he drew them off with a great air, and threw them into the middle
of it,<br>
and then, leisurely taking anither pair off a silver salver which
his ain<br>
man presented, he pat them on for dessert. The M'Nab, who,
although an<br>
auld-fashioned carl, was aye fond of bringing something new hame
to his<br>
friends, remarked the Englisher's proceeding with great care, and
the next<br>
day he appeared at dinner wi' a huge pair of Hieland mittens,
which he<br>
wore, to the astonishment of all and the amusement of most,
through the<br>
whole three courses; and exactly as the Englishman changed his
gloves, the<br>
M'Nab produced a fresh pair of goats' wool, four times as large
as the<br>
first, which, drawing on with prodigious gravity, he threw the
others into<br>
the middle of the cloth, remarking, as he did so,&mdash;</p>

<p>"'Ye see, Captain, we are never ower auld to learn.'</p>

<p>"All propriety was now at an end, and a hearty burst of
laughter from one<br>
end of the table to the other convulsed the whole company,&mdash;the
M'Nab and<br>
the Englishman being the only persons who did not join in it, but
sat<br>
glowering at each other like twa tigers; and, indeed, it needed,
a'<br>
the Montrose's interference that they had na quarrelled upon it
in the<br>
morning."</p>

<p>"The M'Nab was a man after my own heart," said Maurice; "there
was<br>
something very Irish in the lesson he gave the Englishman."</p>

<p>"I'd rather ye'd told him that than me," said the doctor,
dryly; "he would<br>
na hae thanked ye for mistaking him for ane of your
countrymen."</p>

<p>"Come, Doctor," said Dennis, "could not ye give us a stave?
Have ye nothing<br>
that smacks of the brown fern and the blue lakes in your
memory?"</p>

<p>"I have na a sang in my mind just noo except 'Johnny Cope,'
which may be<br>
might na be ower pleasant for the Englishers to listen to."</p>

<p>"I never heard a Scotch song worth sixpence," quoth Maurice,
who seemed<br>
bent on provoking the doctor's ire. "They contain nothing save
some<br>
puling sentimentality about lasses with lint-white locks, or some
absurd<br>
laudations of the Barley Bree."</p>

<p>"Hear till him, hear till him!" said the doctor, reddening
with impatience.</p>

<p>"Show me anything," said Maurice, "like the 'Cruiskeen Lawn'
or the 'Jug<br>
of Punch;' but who can blame them, after all? You can't expect
much from a<br>
people with an imagination as naked as their own knees."</p>

<p>"Maurice! Maurice!" cried O'Shaughnessy, reprovingly, who saw
that he was<br>
pushing the other's endurance beyond all bounds.</p>

<p>"I mind weel," said the Scotchman, "what happened to ane o'
your countrymen<br>
wha took upon him to jest as you are doing now. It was to Laurie
Cameron he<br>
did it."</p>

<p>"And what said the redoubted Laurie in reply?"</p>

<p>"He did na say muckle, but he did something."</p>

<p>"And what might it be?" inquired Maurice.</p>

<p>"He threw him ower the brig of Ayr into the water, and he was
drowned."</p>

<p>"And did Laurie come to no harm about the matter?"</p>

<p>"Ay, they tried him for it, and found him guilty; but when
they asked<br>
him what he had to say in his defence, he merely replied, 'When
the carl<br>
sneered about Scotland, I did na suspect that he did na ken how
to swim;'<br>
and so the end of it was, they did naething to Laurie."</p>

<p>"Cool that, certainly," said I.</p>

<p>"I prefer your friend with the mittens, I confess," said
Maurice, "though<br>
I'm sure both were most agreeable companion. But come, Doctor,
couldn't you<br>
give us,&mdash;</p>

<p>    Sit ye down, my heartie, and gie us a crack,<br>
    Let the wind tak' the care o' the world on his back.'"</p>

<p>"You maunna attempt English poethry, my freend Quell; for it
must be<br>
confessed ye'e a damnable accent of your ain."</p>

<p>"Milesian-Phoenician-Corkacian; nothing more, my boy, and a
coaxing kind<br>
of recitative it is, after all. Don't tell me of your soft
Etruscan, your<br>
plethoric. <i>Hoch</i>-Deutsch, your flattering French. To woo and win
the<br>
girl of your heart, give me a rich brogue and the least taste in
life of<br>
blarney! There's nothing like it, believe me,&mdash;every inflection
of your<br>
voice suggesting some tender pressure of her soft hand or taper
waist,<br>
every cadence falling on her gentle heart like a sea-breeze on a
burning<br>
coast, or a soft sirocco over a rose-tree. And then, think, my
boys,&mdash;and<br>
it is a fine thought after all,&mdash;what a glorious gift that is,
out of the<br>
reach of kings to give or to take, what neither depends upon the
act of<br>
Union nor the <i>Habeas Corpus</i>. No! they may starve us, laugh at
us, tax us,<br>
transport us. They may take our mountains, our valleys, and our
bogs; but,<br>
bad luck to them, they can't steal our 'blarney;' that's the
privilege one<br>
and indivisible with our identity. And while an Englishman raves
of his<br>
liberty, a Scotchman of his oaten meal, blarney's <i>our</i>
birthright, and a<br>
prettier portion I'd never ask to leave behind me to my sons. If
I'd as<br>
large a family as the ould gentleman called Priam we used to hear
of at<br>
school, it's the only inheritance I'd give them, and one comfort
there<br>
would be besides, the legacy duty would be only a trifle.
Charley, my<br>
son, I see you're listening to me, and nothing satisfies me more
than to<br>
instruct inspiring youth; so never forget the old song,&mdash;</p>

<p>    'If at your ease, the girls you'd please,<br>
    And win them, like Kate Kearney,<br>
    There's but one way, I've heard them say,<br>
    Go kiss the Stone of Blarney.'"</p>

<p>"What do you say, Shaugh, if we drink it with all the
honors?"</p>

<p>"But gently: do I hear a trumpet there?"</p>

<p>"Ah, there go the bugles. Can it be daybreak already?"</p>

<p>"How short the nights are at this season!" said Quill.</p>

<p>"What an infernal rumpus they're making! It's not possible the
troops are<br>
to march so early."</p>

<p>"It wouldn't surprise me in the least," quoth Maurice; "there
is no knowing<br>
what the commander-in-chief's not capable of,&mdash;the reason's clear
enough."</p>

<p>"And why, Maurice?"</p>

<p>"There's not a bit of blarney about him."</p>

<p>The <i>r&eacute;veil</i> sang out from every brigade, and the drums
beat to fall in,<br>
while Mike came galloping up at full speed to say that the bridge
of boats<br>
was completed, and that the Twelfth were already ordered to
cross. Not a<br>
moment was therefore to be lost; one parting cup we drained to
our next<br>
meeting, and amidst a hundred "good-bys" we mounted our horses.
Poor<br>
Hampden's brains, sadly confused by the wine and the laughing, he
knew<br>
little of what was going on around him, and passed the entire
time of our<br>
homeward ride in a vain endeavor to adapt "Mary Draper" to the
air of "Rule<br>
Britannia."</p>

<br><br><br><br><p>CHAPTER XXII.</p>

<p>FUENTES D'ONORO.</p>

<p>From this period the French continued their retreat, closely
followed by<br>
the allied armies, and on the 5th of April, Massena once more
crossed the<br>
frontier into Spain, leaving thirty thousand of his bravest
troops behind<br>
him, fourteen thousand of whom had fallen or been taken
prisoners.<br>
Reinforcements, however, came rapidly pouring in. Two divisions
of the<br>
Ninth corps had already arrived, and Drouet, with eleven thousand
infantry<br>
and cavalry, was preparing to march to his assistance. Thus
strengthened,<br>
the French army marched towards the Portuguese frontier, and
Lord<br>
Wellington, who had determined not to hazard much by his blockade
of Ciudad<br>
Rodrigo, fell back upon the large table-land beyond the Turones
and the Dos<br>
Casas, with his left at Fort Conception, and his right resting
upon Fuentes<br>
d'Onoro. His position extended to about five miles; and here,
although<br>
vastly inferior in numbers, yet relying upon the bravery of the
troops, and<br>
the moral ascendency acquired by their pursuit of the enemy, he
finally<br>
resolved upon giving them battle.</p>

<p>Being sent with despatches to Pack's brigade, which formed the
blockading<br>
force at Almeida, I did not reach Fuentes d'Onoro until the
evening of the<br>
3d. The thundering of the guns, which, even at the distance I was
at, was<br>
plainly heard, announced that an attack had taken place, but it
by no means<br>
prepared me for the scene which presented itself on my
return.</p>

<p>The village of Fuentes d'Onoro, one of the most beautiful in
Spain, is<br>
situated in a lovely valley, where all the charms of verdure so
peculiar to<br>
the Peninsula seemed to have been scattered with a lavish hand.
The citron<br>
and the arbutus, growing wild, sheltered every cottage door, and
the<br>
olive and the laurel threw their shadows across the little
rivulet which<br>
traversed the village. The houses, observing no uniform
arrangement,<br>
stood wherever the caprice or the inclination of the builder
suggested,<br>
surrounded with little gardens, the inequality of the ground
imparting a<br>
picturesque feature to even the lowliest hut, while upon a craggy
eminence<br>
above the rest, an ancient convent and a ruined chapel looked
down upon the<br>
little peaceful hamlet with an air of tender protection.</p>

<p>Hitherto this lovely spot had escaped all the ravages of war.
The light<br>
division of our army had occupied it for months long; and every
family was<br>
gratefully remembered by some one or other of our officers, and
more than<br>
one of our wounded found in the kind and affectionate watching of
these<br>
poor peasants the solace which sickness rarely meets with when
far from<br>
home and country.</p>

<p>It was, then, with an anxious heart I pressed my horse forward
into a<br>
gallop as the night drew near. The artillery had been distinctly
heard<br>
during the day, and while I burned with eagerness to know the
result, I<br>
felt scarcely less anxious for the fate of that little hamlet
whose name<br>
many a kind story had implanted in my memory. The moon was
shining brightly<br>
as I passed the outpost, and leading my horse by the bridle,
descended the<br>
steep and rugged causeway to the village beneath me. The lanterns
were<br>
moving rapidly to and fro; the measured tread of infantry at
night&mdash;that<br>
ominous sound, which falls upon the heart so sadly&mdash;told me that
they<br>
were burying the dead. The air was still and breathless; not a
sound was<br>
stirring save the step of the soldiery, and the harsh clash of
the shovel<br>
as it struck the earth. I felt sad and sick at heart, and leaned
against a<br>
tree; a nightingale concealed in the leaves was pouring forth its
plaintive<br>
notes to the night air, and its low warble sounded like the dirge
of the<br>
departed. Far beyond, in the plain, the French watch-fires were
burning,<br>
and I could see from time to time the fatigue-parties moving in
search of<br>
their wounded. At this moment the clock of the convent struck
eleven, and a<br>
merry chime rang out, and was taken up by the echoes till it
melted away in<br>
the distance. Alas, where were those whose hearts were wont to
feel cheered<br>
at that happy peal; whose infancy it had gladdened; whose old age
it has<br>
hallowed? The fallen walls, the broken roof-trees, the ruin and
desolation<br>
on every side, told too plainly that they had passed away
forever! The<br>
smoking embers, the torn-up pathway, denoted the hard-fought
struggle; and<br>
as I passed along, I could see that every garden, where the
cherry and the<br>
apple-blossom were even still perfuming the air, had now its
sepulchre.</p>

<p>"Halt, there!" cried a hoarse voice in front. "You cannot pass
this<br>
way,&mdash;the commander-in-chief's quarters."</p>

<p>I looked up and beheld a small but neat-looking cottage, which
seemed to<br>
have suffered less than the others around. Lights were shining
brightly<br>
from the windows, and I could even detect from time to time a
figure<br>
muffled up in a cloak passing to and fro across the window; while
another,<br>
seated at a table, was occupied in writing. I turned into a
narrow path<br>
which led into the little square of the village, and here, as I
approached,<br>
the hum and murmur of voices announced a bivouac party. Stopping
to ask<br>
what had been the result of the day, I learned that a tremendous
attack<br>
had been made by the French in column upon the village, which was
at first<br>
successful; but that afterwards the Seventy-first and
Seventy-ninth,<br>
marching down from the heights, had repulsed the enemy, and
driven them<br>
beyond the Dos Casas. Five hundred had fallen in that fierce
encounter,<br>
which was continued through every street and alley of the little
hamlet.<br>
The gallant Highlanders now occupied the battle-field; and
hearing that the<br>
cavalry brigade was some miles distant, I willingly accepted
their offer to<br>
share their bivouac, and passed the remainder of the night among
them.</p>

<p>When day broke, our troops were under arms, but the enemy
showed no<br>
disposition to renew the attack. We could perceive, however, from
the road<br>
to the southward, by the long columns of dust, that
reinforcements were<br>
still arriving; and learned during the morning, from a deserter,
that<br>
Massena himself had come up, and Bessi&eacute;res also, with
twelve hundred<br>
cavalry, and a battery of the Imperial Guard.</p>

<p>From the movements observable in the enemy, it was soon
evident that the<br>
battle, though deferred, was not abandoned; and the march of a
strong<br>
force towards the left of their position induced our
commander-in-chief to<br>
despatch the Seventh Division, under Houston, to occupy the
height of Naval<br>
d'Aver&mdash;our extreme right&mdash;in support of which our brigade of
cavalry<br>
marched as a covering force. The British position was thus
unavoidably<br>
extended to the enormous length of seven miles, occupying a
succession of<br>
small eminences, from the division at Fort Conception to the
height of<br>
Naval d'Aver,&mdash;Fuentes d'Onoro forming nearly the centre of the
line.</p>

<p>It was evident, from the thickening combinations of the
French, that a more<br>
dreadful battle was still in reserve for us; and yet never did
men look<br>
more anxiously for the morrow.</p>

<p>As for myself, I felt a species of exhilaration I had never
before<br>
experienced; the events of the preceding day came dropping in
upon me from<br>
every side, and at every new tale of gallantry or daring I felt
my heart<br>
bounding with excited eagerness to win also my need of honorable
praise.</p>

<p>Crawfurd, too, had recognized me in the kindest manner; and
while saying<br>
that he did not wish to withdraw me from my regiment on a day of
battle,<br>
added that he would make use of me for the present on his staff.
Thus was<br>
I engaged, from early in the morning till late in the evening,
bringing<br>
orders and despatches along the line. The troop-horse I rode&mdash;for
I<br>
reserved my gray for the following day&mdash;was scarcely able to
carry me<br>
along, as towards dusk I jogged along in the direction of Naval
d'Aver.<br>
When I did reach our quarters, the fires were lighted, and around
one of<br>
them I had the good fortune to find a party of the Fourteenth
occupied in<br>
discussing a very appetizing little supper. The clatter of
plates, and the<br>
popping of champagne corks were most agreeable sounds. Indeed,
the latter<br>
appeared to me so much too flattering an illusion, that I
hesitated giving<br>
credit to my senses in the matter, when Baker called out,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Come, Charley, sit down; you're just in the nick. Tom Marsden
is giving us<br>
a benefit. You know Tom?"</p>

<p>And here he presented me in due form to that best of
commissaries and most<br>
hospitable of horse-dealers.</p>

<p>"I can't introduce you to my friend on my right," continued
Baker, "for my<br>
Spanish is only a skeleton battalion; but he's a trump,&mdash;that
I'll vouch<br>
for; never flinches his glass, and looks as though he enjoyed all
our<br>
nonsense."</p>

<p>The Spaniard, who appeared to comprehend that he was alluded
to, gravely<br>
saluted me with a low bow, and offered his glass to hobnob with
me. I<br>
returned the curtesy with becoming ceremony, while Hampden
whispered in my<br>
ear,&mdash;</p>

<p>"A fine-looking fellow. You know who he is? Julian, the
Guerilla chief."</p>

<p>I had heard much of both the strangers. Tom Marsden was a
household word<br>
in every cavalry brigade; equally celebrated were his contracts
and his<br>
claret. He knew every one, from Lord Wellington to the
last-joined cornet;<br>
and while upon a march, there was no piece of better fortune than
to be<br>
asked to dine with him. So in the very thick of battle, Tom's
critical eye<br>
was scanning the squadrons engaged, with an accuracy as to the
number of<br>
fresh horses that would be required upon the morrow that nothing
but long<br>
practice and infinite coolness could have conferred.</p>

<p>Of the Guerilla I need not speak. The bold feats he
accomplished, the aid<br>
he rendered to the cause of his country, have made his name
historical. Yet<br>
still with all this, fatigue, more powerful than my curiosity,
prevailed,<br>
and I sank into a heavy sleep upon the grass, while my merry
companions<br>
kept up their revels till near morning. The last piece of
consciousness I<br>
am sensible of was seeing Julian spreading his wide mantle over
me as I<br>
lay, while I heard his deep voice whisper a kind wish for my
repose.</p>

<br><br><br><br><p>CHAPTER XXIII.</p>

<p>THE BATTLE OF FUENTES D'ONORO.</p>

<p>So soundly did I sleep that the tumult and confusion of the
morning never<br>
awoke me; and the Guerilla, whose cavalry were stationed along
the edge of<br>
the ravine near the heights of Echora, would not permit of my
being roused<br>
before the last moment. Mike stood near me with my horses, and it
was only<br>
when the squadrons were actually forming that I sprang to my feet
and<br>
looked around me.</p>

<p>The day was just breaking; a thick mist lay upon the parched
earth, and<br>
concealed everything a hundred yards from where we stood. From
this dense<br>
vapor the cavalry defiled along the base of the hill, followed by
the<br>
horse artillery and the Guards, disappearing again as they passed
us,<br>
but proving, by the mass of troops now assembled, that our
position was<br>
regarded as the probable point of attack.</p>

<p>While the troops continued to take up their position, the sun
shone out,<br>
and a slight breeze blowing at the same, moment, the heavy clouds
moved<br>
past, and we beheld the magnificent panorama of the battle-field.
Before<br>
us, at the distance of less than half a league, the French
cavalry were<br>
drawn up in three strong columns; the Cuirassiers of the Guard,
plainly<br>
distinguished by their steel cuirasses, flanked by the Polish
Lancers and a<br>
strong huzzar brigade; a powerful artillery train supported the
left, and<br>
an infantry force occupied the entire space between the right and
the<br>
rising ground opposite Po&ccedil;o Velho. Farther to the right
again, the column<br>
destined for the attack of Fuentes d'Onoro were forming, and we
could see<br>
that, profiting by their past experience, they were bent upon
attacking the<br>
village with an overwhelming force.</p>

<p>For above two hours the French continued to manoeuvre, more
than one<br>
alteration having taken place in their disposition; fresh
battalions were<br>
moved towards the front, and gradually the whole of their cavalry
was<br>
assembled on the extreme left in front of our position. Our
people were<br>
ordered to breakfast where we stood; and a little after seven
o'clock a<br>
staff officer came riding down the line, followed in a few
moments after by<br>
General Crawfurd, when no sooner was his well-known brown cob
recognized by<br>
the troops than a hearty cheer greeted him along the whole
division.</p>

<p>"Thank ye, boys; thank ye, boys, with all my heart. No man
feels more<br>
sensibly what that cheer means than I do. Guards, Lord Wellington
relies<br>
upon your maintaining this position, which is essential to the
safety of<br>
the whole line. You will be supported by the light division. I
need say<br>
no more. If such troops cannot keep their ground, none can.
Fourteenth,<br>
there's your place; the artillery and the Sixteenth are with you.
They've<br>
the odds of us in numbers, lads; but it will tell all the better
in the<br>
'Gazette.' I see they're moving; so fall in now, fall in; and
Merivale,<br>
move to the front. Ramsey, prepare to open your fire on the
attacking<br>
squadrons."</p>

<p>As he spoke, the low murmuring sound of distantly moving
cavalry crept<br>
along the earth, growing louder and louder, till at length we
could detect<br>
the heavy tramp of the squadrons as they came on in a trot, our
pace<br>
being merely a walk. While we thus advanced into the plain, the
artillery<br>
unlimbered behind us, and the Spanish cavalry, breaking into
skirmishers,<br>
dashed boldly to the front.</p>

<p>It was an exciting moment. The ground dipped between the two
armies so<br>
as to conceal the head of the advancing column of the French, and
as the<br>
Spanish skirmishers disappeared down the ridge, our beating
hearts and<br>
straining eyes followed their last horseman.</p>

<p>"Halt! halt!" was passed from squadron to squadron, and the
same instant<br>
the sharp ring of the pistol shots and the clash of steel from
the valley,<br>
told us the battle had begun. We could hear the Guerilla war-cry
mingle<br>
with the French shout, while the thickening crash of fire-arms
implied a<br>
sharper conflict. Our fellows were already manifesting some
impatience<br>
to press on, when a Spanish horseman appeared above the ridge,
another<br>
followed, and another, and then pell-mell, broken and disordered,
they<br>
fell back before the pursuing cavalry in flying masses; while the
French,<br>
charging them hotly home, utterly routed and repulsed them.</p>

<p>The leading squadrons of the French now fell back upon their
support; the<br>
column of attack thickened, and a thundering noise between their
masses<br>
announced their brigade of light guns as they galloped to the
front. It was<br>
then for the first time that I felt dispirited; far as my eye
could stretch<br>
the dense mass of sabres extended, defiling from the distant
hills and<br>
winding its slow length across the plain. I turned to look at our
line,<br>
scarce one thousand strong, and could not help feeling that our
hour was<br>
come: the feeling flashed vividly across my mind, but the next
instant I<br>
felt my cheek redden with shame as I gazed upon the sparkling
eyes and bold<br>
looks around me, the lips compressed, the hands knitted to their
sabres;<br>
all were motionless, but burning to advance.</p>

<p>The French had halted on the brow of the hill to form, when
Merivale came<br>
cantering up to us.</p>

<p>"Fourteenth, are you ready? Are you ready, lads?"</p>

<p>"Ready, sir! ready!" re-echoed along the line.</p>

<p>"Then push them home and charge! Charge!" cried he, raising
his voice to a<br>
shout at the last word.</p>

<p>Heavens, what a crash was there! Our horses, in top condition,
no sooner<br>
felt the spur than they bounded madly onwards. The pace&mdash;for the
distance<br>
did not exceed four hundred yards&mdash;was like racing. To resist the
impetus<br>
of our approach was impossible; and without a shot fired,
scarcely a<br>
sabre-cut exchanged, we actually rode down their advanced
squadrons,<br>
hurling them headlong upon their supporting division, and rolling
men and<br>
horses beneath us on every side. The French fell back upon their
artillery;<br>
but before they could succeed in opening their fire upon us, we
had<br>
wheeled, and carrying off about seventy prisoners, galloped back
to our<br>
position with the loss of but two men in the affair. The whole
thing was so<br>
sudden, so bold, and so successful, that I remember well, as we
rode<br>
back, a hearty burst of laughter was ringing through the squadron
at the<br>
ludicrous display of horsemanship the French presented as they
tumbled<br>
headlong down the hill; and I cannot help treasuring the
recollection,<br>
for from that moment, all thought of anything short of victory
completely<br>
quitted my mind, and many of my brother officers, who had
participated in<br>
my feelings at the commencement of the day, confessed to me
afterwards that<br>
it was then for the first time they felt assured of beating the
enemy.</p>

<p>While we slowly fell back to our position, the French were
seen advancing<br>
in great force from the village of Almeida, to the attack of
Po&ccedil;o Velho;<br>
they came on at a rapid pace, their artillery upon their front
and flank,<br>
large masses of cavalry hovering around them. The attack upon the
village<br>
was now opened by the large guns; and amidst the booming of the
artillery<br>
and the crashing volleys of small fire-arms, rose the shout of
the<br>
assailants, and the wild cry of the Guerilla cavalry, who had
formed in<br>
front of the village. The French advanced firmly, driving back
the pickets,<br>
and actually inundated the devoted village with a shower of
grape; the<br>
blazing fires burst from the ignited roofs; and the black, dense
smoke,<br>
rising on high, seemed to rest like a pall over the little
hamlet.</p>

<p>The conflict was now a tremendous one; our Seventh Division
held the<br>
village with the bayonet; but the French continuing to pour in
mass upon<br>
mass, drove them back with loss, and at the end of an hour's hard
fighting,<br>
took possession of the place.</p>

<p>The wood upon the left flank was now seen to swarm with light
infantry, and<br>
the advancement of their whole left proved that they meditated to
turn our<br>
flank; the space between the village and the hill of Naval d'Aver
became<br>
thus the central position; and here the Guerilla force, led on by
Julian<br>
Sanches, seemed to await the French with confidence. Soon,
however, the<br>
cuirassiers came galloping to the spot, and almost without
exchanging a<br>
sabre-cut, the Guerillas fell back, and retired behind the
Turones. This<br>
movement of Julian was more attributable to anger than to fear;
for his<br>
favorite lieutenant, being mistaken for a French officer, was
shot by a<br>
soldier of the Guards a few minutes before.</p>

<p>Montbrun pursued the Guerillas with some squadrons of horse,
but they<br>
turned resolutely upon the French, and not till overwhelmed by
numbers did<br>
they show any disposition to retreat.</p>

<p>The French, however, now threw forward their whole cavalry,
and driving<br>
back the English horse, succeeded in turning the right of the
Seventh<br>
Division. The battle by this time was general. The staff officers
who came<br>
up from the left informed us that Fuentes d'Onoro was attacked in
force,<br>
Massena himself leading the assault in person; while thus for
seven miles<br>
the fight was maintained hotly at intervals, it was evident that
upon the<br>
maintenance of our position the fortune of the day depended.
Hitherto we<br>
had been repulsed from the village and the wood; and the dark
masses of<br>
infantry which were assembled upon our right, seemed to threaten
the hill<br>
of Naval d'Aver with as sad a catastrophe.</p>

<p>Crawfurd came now galloping up among us, his eye flashing
fire, and his<br>
uniform splashed and covered with foam:</p>

<p>"Steady Sixteenth, steady! Don't blow your horses! Have your
fellows<br>
advanced, Malcolm?" said he, turning to an officer who stood
beside him.<br>
"Ay, there they go!" pointing with his finger to the wood where,
as he<br>
spoke, the short ringing of the British rifle proclaimed the
advance of<br>
that brigade. "Let the cavalry prepare to charge! And now,
Ramsey, let us<br>
give it them home!"</p>

<p>Scarcely were the words spoken, when the squadrons were
formed, and in an<br>
instant after, the French light infantry were seen retreating
from the<br>
wood, and flying in disorderly masses across the plain. Our
squadrons<br>
riding down among them, actually cut them to atoms, while the
light<br>
artillery, unlimbering, threw in a deadly discharge of
grape-shot.</p>

<p>"To the right, Fourteenth, to the right!" cried General
Stewart. "Have at<br>
their hussars!"</p>

<p>Whirling by them, we advanced at a gallop, and dashed towards
the enemy,<br>
who, not less resolutely bent, came boldly forward to meet us.
The shock<br>
was terrific! The leading squadrons on both sides went down
almost to a<br>
man, and all order being lost, the encounter became one of hand
to hand.</p>

<p>The struggle was deadly; neither party would give way; and
while fortune<br>
now inclined hither and thither, Sir Charles Stewart singled out
the French<br>
general, Lamotte, and carried him off his prisoner. Meanwhile
Montbrun's<br>
cavalry and the cuirassiers came riding up, and the retreat now
sounding<br>
through our ranks, we were obliged to fall back upon the
infantry. The<br>
French pursued us hotly; and so rapid was their movement, that
before<br>
Ramsey's brigade could limber up and away, their squadrons had
surrounded<br>
him and captured his guns.</p>

<p>"Where is Ramsey?" cried Crawfurd, as he galloped to the head
of our<br>
division. "Cut off&mdash;cut off! Taken, by G&mdash;&mdash;! There he goes!"
said he,<br>
pointing with his finger, as a dense cloud of mingled smoke and
dust moved<br>
darkly across the plain. "Form into column once more!"</p>

<p>As he spoke, the dense mass before us seemed agitated by some
mighty<br>
commotion; the flashing of blades, and the rattling of
small-arms, mingled<br>
with shouts of triumph or defiance, burst forth, and the ominous
cloud<br>
lowering more darkly, seemed peopled by those in deadly strife.
An English<br>
cheer pealed high above all other sounds; a second followed; the
mass was<br>
rent asunder, and like the forked lightning from a thunder-cloud,
Ramsey<br>
rode forth at the head of his battery, the horses bounding madly,
while the<br>
guns sprang behind them like things of no weight; the gunners
leaped to<br>
their places, and fighting hand to hand with the French cavalry,
they flew<br>
across the plain.</p>

<p>"Nobly done, gallant Ramsey!" said a voice behind me. I turned
at the<br>
sound; it was Lord Wellington who spoke. My eye fixed upon his
stern<br>
features, I forgot all else; when he suddenly recalled me to
my<br>
recollection by saying,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Follow your brigade, sir. Charge!"</p>

<p>In an instant I was with my people, who, intervening betwixt
Ramsey and his<br>
pursuers, repulsed the enemy with loss, and carried off several
prisoners.<br>
The French, however, came up in greater strength; overwhelming
masses of<br>
cavalry came sweeping upon us, and we were obliged to retire
behind the<br>
light division, which rapidly formed into squares to resist the
cavalry.<br>
The Seventh Division, which was more advanced, were, however, too
late for<br>
this movement, and before they could effect their formation, the
French<br>
were upon them. At this moment they owed their safety to the
Chasseurs<br>
Britanniques, who poured in a flanking fire, so close, and with
so deadly<br>
an aim, that their foes recoiled, beaten and bewildered.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the French had become masters of Pogo Velho; the
formidable<br>
masses had nearly outflanked us on the right. The battle was lost
if we<br>
could not fall back upon our original position, and concentrate
our force<br>
upon Fuentes d'Onoro. To effect this was a work of great
difficulty; but<br>
no time was to be lost. The Seventh Division were ordered to
cross the<br>
Turones, while Crawfurd, forming the light division into squares,
covered<br>
their retreat, and supported by the cavalry, sustained the whole
force of<br>
the enemy's attack.</p>

<p>Then was the moment to witness the cool and steady bravery of
British<br>
infantry; the squares dotted across the enormous plain seemed as
nothing<br>
amidst that confused and flying multitude, composed of
commissariat<br>
baggage, camp-followers, peasants, and finally, broken pickets
and videttes<br>
arriving from the wood. A cloud of cavalry hovered and darkened
around<br>
them; the Polish Lancers shook their long spears, impatient of
delay, and<br>
the wild huzzas burst momentarily from their squadrons as they
waited for<br>
the word to attack. But the British stood firm and undaunted; and
although<br>
the enemy rode round their squares, Montbrun himself at their
head, they<br>
never dared to charge them. Meanwhile the Seventh Division fell
back, as<br>
if on a parade, and crossing the river, took up their ground at
Frenada,<br>
pivoting upon the First Division; the remainder of the line also
fell back,<br>
and assumed a position at right angles with their former one, the
cavalry<br>
forming in front, and holding the French in check during the
movement. This<br>
was a splendid manoeuvre, and when made in face of an
overnumbering enemy,<br>
one unmatched during the whole war.</p>

<p>At sight of this new front, the French stopped short, and
opened a fire<br>
from their heavy guns. The British batteries replied with vigor
and<br>
silenced the enemy's cannon. The cavalry drew out of range, and
the<br>
infantry gradually fell back to their former position. While this
was going<br>
on, the attack upon Fuentes d'Onoro was continued with unabated
vigor.<br>
The three British regiments in the lower town were pierced by
the<br>
French tirailleurs, who poured upon them in overwhelming numbers;
the<br>
Seventy-ninth were broken, ten companies taken, and Cameron,
their colonel,<br>
mortally wounded. Thus the lower village was in the hands of the
enemy,<br>
while from the upper town the incessant roll of musketry
proclaimed the<br>
obstinate resistance of the British.</p>

<p>At this period the reserves were called up from the right, in
time to<br>
resist the additional troops which Drouet continued to bring on.
The<br>
French, reinforced by the whole Sixth Corps, now came forward at
a<br>
quick-step. Dashing through the ruined streets of the lower town,
they<br>
crossed the rivulet, fighting bravely, and charged against the
height.<br>
Already their leading files had gained the crag beside the
chapel. A French<br>
colonel holding his cap upon his sword-point waved on his
men.</p>

<p>The grizzly features of the grenadiers soon appeared, and the
dark column,<br>
half-climbing, half-running, were seen scaling the height. A
rifle-bullet<br>
sent the French leader tumbling from the precipice; and a
cheer&mdash;mad and<br>
reckless as the war-cry of an Indian&mdash;rent the sky, as the 71st
and 79th<br>
Highlanders sprang upon the enemy.</p>

<p>Our part was a short one; advancing in half squadrons, we were
concealed<br>
from the observation of the enemy by the thick vineyards which
skirted the<br>
lower town, waiting, with impatience, the moment when our gallant
infantry<br>
should succeed in turning the tide of battle. We were ordered to
dismount,<br>
and stood with our bridles on our arms, anxious and expectant.
The charge<br>
of the French column was made close to where we were
standing,&mdash;the<br>
inspiriting cheers of the officers, the loud <i>vivas</i> of the men,
were<br>
plainly heard by us as they rushed to the assault; but the space
between<br>
us was intersected by walls and brushwood, which totally
prevented the<br>
movements of cavalry.</p>

<p>Fearlessly their dark column moved up the heights, fixing the
bayonets<br>
as they went. No tirailleurs preceded them, but the tall shako of
the<br>
Grenadier of the Guard was seen in the first rank. Long before
the end of<br>
the column had passed us, the leading files were in action. A
deafening<br>
peal of musketry&mdash;so loud, so dense, it seemed like
artillery&mdash;burst forth.<br>
A volume of black smoke rolled heavily down from the heights and
hid all<br>
from our view, except when the vivid lightning of the platoon
firing rent<br>
the veil asunder, and showed us the troops almost in hand to hand
conflict.</p>

<p>"It's Picton's Division, I'm certain," cried Merivale; "I hear
the bagpipes<br>
of the Highlanders."</p>

<p>"You are right, sir," said Hampden, "the Seventy-first are in
the same<br>
brigade, and I know their bugles well. There they go again!"</p>

<p>"Fourteenth! Fourteenth!" cried a voice from behind, and at
the same<br>
moment, a staff officer, without his hat, and his horse bleeding
from a<br>
recent sabre-cut, came up. "You must move to the rear, Colonel
Merivale;<br>
the French have gained the heights! Move round by the causeway;
bring up<br>
your squadrons as quickly as you can, and support the
infantry!"</p>

<p>In a moment we were in our saddles; but scarcely was the word
"to fall in"<br>
given, when a loud cheer rent the very air; the musketry seemed
suddenly<br>
to cease, and the dark mass which continued to struggle up the
heights<br>
wavered, broke, and turned.</p>

<p>"What can that be?" said Merivale. "What can it mean?"</p>

<p>"I can tell you, sir," said I, proudly, while I felt my heart
throb as<br>
though it would bound from my bosom.</p>

<p>"And what is it, boy? Speak!"</p>

<p>"There it goes again! That was an Irish shout! The
Eighty-eighth are at<br>
them!"</p>

<p>"By Jove, here they come!" said Hampden. "God help the
Frenchmen now!"</p>

<p>The words were not well spoken, when the red coats of our
gallant fellows<br>
were seen dashing through the vineyard.</p>

<p>"The steel, boys; nothing but the steel!" shouted a loud voice
from the<br>
crag above our heads.</p>

<p>I looked up. It was the stern Picton himself who spoke. The
Eighty-eighth<br>
now led the pursuit, and sprang from rock to rock in all the
mad<br>
impetuosity of battle; and like some mighty billow rolling before
the gale,<br>
the French went down the heights.</p>

<p>"Gallant Eighty-eighth! Gloriously done!" cried Picton, as he
waved his<br>
hat.</p>

<p>"Aren't we Connaught robbers, now?" shouted a rich brogue, as
its owner,<br>
breathless and bleeding, pressed forward in the charge.</p>

<p>A hearty burst of laughter mingled with the din of the
battle.</p>

<p>"Now for it, boys! Now for <i>our</i> work!" said old Merivale,
drawing his<br>
sabre as he spoke. "Forward! and charge!"</p>

<p>We waited not a second bidding, but bursting from our
concealment,<br>
galloped down into the broken column. It was no regular charge,
but an<br>
indiscriminate rush. Scarcely offering resistance, the enemy fell
beneath<br>
our sabres, or the still more deadly bayonets of the infantry,
who were<br>
inextricably mingled up in the conflict.</p>

<p>The chase was followed up for above half a mile, when we fell
back,<br>
fortunately in good time; for the French had opened a heavy fire
from their<br>
artillery, and regardless of their own retreating column, poured
a shower<br>
of grape among our squadrons. As we retired, the struggling files
of the<br>
Rangers joined us,&mdash;their faces and accoutrements blackened and
begrimed<br>
with powder; many of them, themselves wounded, had captured
prisoners; and<br>
one huge fellow of the grenadier company was seen driving before
him a<br>
no less powerful Frenchman, and to whom, as he turned from time
to time<br>
reluctantly, and scowled upon his jailer, the other vociferated
some Irish<br>
imprecation, whose harsh intentions were made most palpably
evident by a<br>
flourish of a drawn bayonet.</p>

<p>"Who is he?" said Mike; "who is he, ahagur?"</p>

<p>"Sorra one o' me knows," said the other; "but it's the chap
that shot<br>
Lieutenant Mahony, and I never took my eye off him after; and if
the<br>
lieutenant's not dead, sure it'll be a satisfaction to him that I
cotch<br>
him."</p>

<p>The lower town was now evacuated by the French, who retired
beyond the<br>
range of our artillery; the upper continued in the occupation of
our<br>
troops; and worn out and exhausted, surrounded by dead and dying,
both<br>
parties abandoned the contest, and the battle was over.</p>

<p>Both sides laid claim to the victory; the French, because,
having taken the<br>
village of Po&ccedil;o Velho, they had pierced the British line,
and compelled<br>
them to fall back and assume a new position; the British, because
the<br>
attack upon Fuentes d'Onoro has been successfully resisted, and
the<br>
blockade of Almeida&mdash;the real object of the battle&mdash;maintained.
The loss<br>
to each was tremendous; fifteen hundred men and officers, of whom
three<br>
hundred were prisoners, were lost by the allies, and a far
greater number<br>
fell among the forces of the enemy.</p>

<p>After the action, a brigade of the light division released the
troops in<br>
the village, and the armies bivouacked once more in sight of each
other.</p>

<br><br><br><br><p>CHAPTER XXIV.</p>

<p>A RENCONTRE.</p>

<p>"LIEUTENANT O'MALLEY, 14th Light Dragoons, to serve as extra
aide-de-camp<br>
to Major-General Crawfurd, until the pleasure of his Royal
Highness the<br>
Prince Regent is known." Such was the first paragraph of a
general order,<br>
dated Fuentes d'Onoro, the day after the battle, which met me as
I woke<br>
from a sound and heavy slumber, the result of thirteen hours on
horseback.</p>

<p>A staff appointment was not exactly what I desired at the
moment; but I<br>
knew that with Crawfurd my duties were more likely to be at the
pickets and<br>
advanced posts of the army, than in the mere details of
note-writing or<br>
despatch-bearing; besides that, I felt, whenever anything of
importance<br>
was to be done, I should always obtain his permission to do duty
with my<br>
regiment.</p>

<p>Taking a hurried breakfast, therefore, I mounted my horse, and
cantered<br>
over to Villa Formosa, where the general's quarters were, to
return my<br>
thanks for the promotion, and take the necessary steps for
assuming my new<br>
functions.</p>

<p>Although the sun had risen about two hours, the fatigue of the
previous day<br>
had impressed itself upon all around. The cavalry, men and
horses, were<br>
still stretched upon the sward, sunk in sleep; the videttes,
weary and<br>
tired, seemed anxiously watching for the relief; and the
disordered and<br>
confused appearance of everything bespoke that discipline had
relaxed its<br>
stern features, in compassion for the bold exertions of the
preceding day.<br>
The only contrast to this general air of exhaustion and weariness
on every<br>
side was a corps of sappers, who were busily employed upon the
high grounds<br>
above the village. Early as it was, they seemed to have been at
work<br>
some hours,&mdash;at least so their labors bespoke; for already a
rampart<br>
of considerable extent had been thrown up, stockades implanted,
and a<br>
breastwork was in a state of active preparation. The officer of
the party,<br>
wrapped up in a loose cloak, and mounted upon a sharp-looking
hackney, rode<br>
hither and thither as the occasion warranted, and seemed, as well
as from<br>
the distance I could guess, something of a tartar. At least I
could not<br>
help remarking how, at his approach, the several inferior
officers seemed<br>
suddenly so much more on the alert, and the men worked with an
additional<br>
vigor and activity. I stopped for some minutes to watch him, and
seeing<br>
an engineer captain of my acquaintance among the party, couldn't
resist<br>
calling out:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I say, Hatchard, your friend on the chestnut mare must have
had an easier<br>
day yesterday than some of us, or I'll be hanged if he'd be so
active this<br>
morning." Hatchard hung his head in some confusion, and did not
reply;<br>
and on my looking round, whom should I see before me but the
identical<br>
individual I had so coolly been criticising, and who, to my utter
horror<br>
and dismay, was no other than Lord Wellington himself. I did not
wait for a<br>
second peep. Helter-skelter, through water, thickets, and
brambles, away I<br>
went, clattering down the causeway like a madman. If a French
squadron had<br>
been behind me, I should have had a stouter heart, although I did
not fear<br>
pursuit. I felt his eye was upon me,&mdash;his sharp and piercing
glance, that<br>
shot like an arrow into me; and his firm look stared at me in
every object<br>
around.</p>

<p>Onward I pressed, feeling in the very recklessness of my
course some relief<br>
to my sense of shame, and ardently hoping that some
accident&mdash;some smashed<br>
arm or broken collar-bone&mdash;might befall me and rescue me from any
notice<br>
my conduct might otherwise call for. I never drew rein till I
reached the<br>
Villa Formosa, and pulled up short at a small cottage where a
double sentry<br>
apprised me of the general's quarters. As I came up, the low
lattice sprang<br>
quickly open, and a figure, half dressed, and more than half
asleep,<br>
protruded his head.</p>

<p>"Well, what has happened? Anything wrong?" said he, whom I now
recognized<br>
to be General Crawfurd.</p>

<p>"No, nothing wrong, sir," stammered I, with evident confusion.
"I'm merely<br>
come to thank you for your kindness in my behalf."</p>

<p>"You seemed in a devil of a hurry to do it, if I'm to judge by
the pace<br>
you came at. Come in and take your breakfast with us; I shall be
dressed<br>
presently, and you'll meet some of your brother
aides-de-camp."</p>

<p>Having given my horse to an orderly, I walked into a little
room, whose<br>
humble accommodations and unpretending appearance seemed in
perfect<br>
keeping with the simple and unostentatious character of the
general. The<br>
preparations for a good and substantial breakfast were, however,
before<br>
me, and an English newspaper of a late date spread its most ample
pages<br>
to welcome me. I had not been long absorbed in my reading, when
the door<br>
opened, and the general, whose toilet was not yet completed, made
his<br>
appearance.</p>

<p>"Egad, O'Malley, you startled me this morning. I thought we
were in for it<br>
again."</p>

<p>I took this as the most seasonable opportunity to recount my
mishap of the<br>
morning, and accordingly, without more ado, detailed the unlucky
meeting<br>
with the commander-in-chief. When I came to the end, Crawfurd
threw himself<br>
into a chair and laughed till the very tears coursed down his
bronzed<br>
features.</p>

<p>"You don't say so, boy? You don't really tell me you said
that? By Jove! I<br>
had rather have faced a platoon of musketry than have stood in
your shoes!<br>
You did not wait for a reply, I think?"</p>

<p>"No, faith, sir, that I did not!"</p>

<p>"Do you suspect he knows you?"</p>

<p>"I trust not, sir; the whole thing passed so rapidly!"</p>

<p>"Well, it's most unlucky in more ways than one!" He paused for
a few<br>
moments as he said this, and then added, "Have you seen the
general order?"<br>
pushing towards me a written paper as he spoke. It ran
thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>    G.O.      ADJUTANT-GENERAL'S OFFICE, VILLA FORMOSA,</p>

<p>    May 6, 1811.</p>

<p>    <i>Memorandum</i>.&mdash;Commanding officers are requested to send
in to<br>
    the military secretary, as soon as possible, the names of
officers they<br>
    may wish to have promoted in succession to those who have
fallen<br>
    in action."</p>

<p>"Now look at this list. The Honorable Harvey Howard, Grenadier
Guards,<br>
to be first lieutenant, <i>vice</i>&mdash;No, not that. Henry
Beauchamp&mdash;George<br>
Villiers&mdash;ay, here it is! Captain Lyttleton, Fourteenth Light
Dragoons,<br>
to be major in the Third Dragoon Guards, <i>vice</i> Godwin, killed in
action;<br>
Lieutenant O'Malley to be captain, <i>vice</i> Lyttleton, promoted.
You see,<br>
boy, I did not forget you; you were to have had the vacant troop
in your<br>
own regiment. Now I almost doubt the prudence of bringing your
name under<br>
Lord Wellington's notice. He may have recognized you; and if he
did so,<br>
why, I rather think&mdash;that is, I suspect&mdash;I mean, the quieter you
keep the<br>
better."</p>

<p>While I poured forth my gratitude as warmly as I was able for
the general's<br>
great kindness to me, I expressed my perfect concurrence in his
views.</p>

<p>"Believe me, sir," said I, "I should much rather wait any
number of years<br>
for my promotion, than incur the risk of a reprimand; the more
so, as it is<br>
not the first time I have blundered with his lordship." I here
narrated<br>
my former meeting with Sir Arthur, at which Crawfurd's mirth
again burst<br>
forth, and he paced the room, holding his sides in an ecstasy of
merriment.</p>

<p>"Come, come, lad, we'll hope for the best; we'll give you the
chance that<br>
he has not seen your face, and send the list forward as it is.
But here<br>
come our fellows."</p>

<p>As he spoke, the door opened, and three officers of his staff
entered, to<br>
whom, being severally introduced, we chatted away about the news
of the<br>
morning until breakfast.</p>

<p>"I've frequently heard of you from my friend Hammersley," said
Captain<br>
Fitzroy, addressing me. "You were intimately acquainted, I
believe?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes! Pray, where is he now? We have not met for a long
time."</p>

<p>"The poor fellow's invalided; that sabre-cut upon his head has
turned out<br>
a sad affair, and he's gone back to England on a sick leave. Old
Dashwood<br>
took him back with him as private secretary, or something of that
sort."</p>

<p>"Ah!" said another, "Dashwood has daughters, hasn't he? No bad
notion of<br>
his; for Hammersley will be a baronet some of these days, with a
rent-roll<br>
of eight or nine thousand per annum."</p>

<p>"Sir George Dashwood," said I, "has but one daughter, and I am
quite sure<br>
that in his kindness to Hammersley no intentions of the kind you
mention<br>
were mixed up."</p>

<p>"Well, I don't know," said the third, a pale, sickly youth,
with handsome<br>
but delicate features. "I was on Dashwood's staff until a few
weeks ago,<br>
and certainly I thought there was something going on between
Hammersley<br>
and Miss Lucy, who, be it spoken, is a devilish fine girl, though
rather<br>
disposed to give herself airs."</p>

<p>I felt my cheek and my temples boiling like a furnace; my hand
trembled as<br>
I lifted my coffee to my lips; and I would have given my expected
promotion<br>
twice over to have had any reasonable ground of quarrel with the
speaker.</p>

<p>"Egad, lads," said Crawfurd, "that's the very best thing I
know about a<br>
command. As a bishop is always sure to portion off his daughters
with<br>
deaneries and rectories, so your knowing old general always
marries his<br>
among his staff."</p>

<p>This sally was met with the ready laughter of the
subordinates, in which,<br>
however little disposed. I was obliged to join.</p>

<p>"You are quite right, sir," rejoined the pale youth; "and Sir
George has no<br>
fortune to give his daughter."</p>

<p>"How came it, Horace, that you got off safe?" said Fitzroy,
with a certain<br>
air of affected seriousness in his voice and manner. "I wonder
they let<br>
such a prize escape them."</p>

<p>"Well, it was not exactly their fault, I do confess. Old
Dashwood did the<br>
civil towards me, and <i>la belle Lucie</i> herself was condescending
enough to<br>
be less cruel than to the rest of the staff. Her father threw us
a good<br>
deal together; and in fact, I believe&mdash;I fear&mdash;that is&mdash;that I
didn't<br>
behave quite well."</p>

<p>"You may rest perfectly assured of it, sir," said I; "whatever
your<br>
previous conduct may have been, you have completely relieved your
mind on<br>
this occasion, and behaved most shamefully."</p>

<p>Had a shell fallen in the midst of us, the faces around me
could not have<br>
been more horror-struck than when, in a cool, determined tone, I
spoke<br>
these few words. Fitzroy pushed his chair slightly back from the
table, and<br>
fixed his eyes full upon me. Crawfurd grew dark-purple over his
whole face<br>
and forehead, and looked from one to the other of us without
speaking;<br>
while the Honorable Horace Delawar, the individual addressed,
never changed<br>
a muscle of his wan and sickly features, but lifting his eyes
slowly from<br>
his muffin, lisped softly out,&mdash;</p>

<p>"You think so? How very good!"</p>

<p>"General Crawfurd," said I, the moment I could collect myself
sufficiently<br>
to speak, "I am deeply grieved that I should so far have
forgotten myself<br>
as to disturb the harmony of your table; but when I tell you that
Sir<br>
George Dashwood is one of my warmest friends on earth; that from
my<br>
intimate knowledge of him, I am certain that gentleman's
statements are<br>
either the mere outpourings of folly or worse&mdash;"</p>

<p>"By Jove, O'Malley! you have a very singular mode of
explaining away the<br>
matter. Delawar, sit down again. Gentlemen, I have only one word
to say<br>
about this transaction; I'll have no squabbles nor broils here;
from this<br>
room to the guard-house is a five minutes' walk. Promise me, upon
your<br>
honors, this altercation ends here, or as sure as my name's
Crawfurd, you<br>
shall both be placed under arrest, and the man who refuses to
obey me shall<br>
be sent back to England."</p>

<p>Before I well knew in what way to proceed, Mr. Delawar rose
and bowed<br>
formally to the general, while I imitated his example; silently
we resumed<br>
our places, and after a pause of a few moments, the current of
conversation<br>
was renewed, and other topics discussed, but with such evident
awkwardness<br>
and constraint that all parties felt relieved when the general
rose from<br>
table.</p>

<p>"I say, O'Malley, have you forwarded the returns to the
adjutant-general's<br>
office?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; I despatched them this morning before leaving my
quarters."</p>

<p>"I am glad of it; the irregularities on this score have called
forth a<br>
heavy reprimand at headquarters."</p>

<p>I was also glad of it, and it chanced that by mere accident I
remembered to<br>
charge Mike with the papers, which, had they not been lying
unsealed upon<br>
the table before me, would, in all likelihood, have escaped my
attention.<br>
The post started to Lisbon that same morning, to take advantage
of which<br>
I had sat up writing for half the night. Little was I aware at
the<br>
moment what a mass of trouble and annoyance was in store for me
from the<br>
circumstance.</p>

<br><br><br><br><p>CHAPTER XXV.</p>

<p>ALMEIDA.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 7th we perceived, from a movement in the
French camp,<br>
that the wounded were being sent to the rear, and shortly
afterwards the<br>
main body of their army commenced its retreat. They moved with
slow, and as<br>
it were, reluctant steps; and Bessi&eacute;res, who commanded the
Imperial Guard,<br>
turned his eyes more than once to that position which all the
bravery of<br>
his troops was unavailing to capture. Although our cavalry lay in
force to<br>
the front of our line, no attempt was made to molest the
retreating French;<br>
and Massena, having retired beyond the Aguada, left a strong
force to watch<br>
the ford, while the remainder of the army fell back upon Cuidad
Rodrigo.</p>

<p>During this time we had succeeded in fortifying our position
at Fuentes<br>
d'Onoro so strongly as to resist any new attack, and Lord
Wellington now<br>
turned his whole attention to the blockade of Almeida, which, by
Massena's<br>
retreat, was abandoned to its fate.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 10th I accompanied General Crawfurd in
a<br>
reconnoissance of the fortress, which, from the intelligence we
had lately<br>
received, could not much longer hold out against our blockade.
The fire<br>
from the enemy's artillery was, however, hotly maintained; and as
night<br>
fell, some squadrons of the Fourteenth, who were picketed near,
were unable<br>
to light their watch-fires, being within reach of their shot. As
the<br>
darkness increased so did the cannonade, and the bright flashes
from the<br>
walls and the deep booming of the artillery became incessant.</p>

<p>A hundred conjectures were afloat to account for the
circumstance; some<br>
asserting that what we heard were mere signals to Massena's army;
and<br>
others, that Brennier was destroying and mutilating the fortress
before he<br>
evacuated it to the allies.</p>

<p>It was little past midnight when, tired from the fatigues of
the day, I had<br>
fallen asleep beneath a tree, an explosion, louder than any which
preceded<br>
it, burst suddenly forth, and as I awoke and looked about me, I
perceived<br>
the whole heavens illuminated by one bright glare, while the
crashing<br>
noise of falling stones and crumbling masonry told me that a mine
had been<br>
sprung; the moment after, all was calm and still and motionless;
a thick<br>
black smoke increasing the sombre darkness of the night shut out
every star<br>
from view, and some drops of heavy rain began to fall.</p>

<p>The silence, ten times more appalling than the din which
preceded it,<br>
weighed heavily upon my senses, and a dread of some unknown
danger crept<br>
over me; the exhaustion, however, was greater than my fear, and
again I<br>
sank into slumber.</p>

<p>Scarcely had I been half an hour asleep, when the blast of a
trumpet again<br>
awoke me, and I found, amidst the confusion and excitement about,
that<br>
something of importance had occurred. Questions were eagerly
asked on all<br>
sides, but no one could explain what had happened. Towards the
town all was<br>
as still as death, but a dropping, irregular fire of musketry
issued from<br>
the valley beside the Aguada. "What can this mean; what can it
be?" we<br>
asked of each other. "A sortie from the garrison," said one; "A
night<br>
attack by Massena's troops," cried another; and while thus we
disputed and<br>
argued, a horseman was heard advancing along the road at the top
of his<br>
speed.</p>

<p>"Where are the cavalry?" cried a voice I recognized as one of
my brother<br>
aides-de-camp. "Where are the Fourteenth?"</p>

<p>A cheer from our party answered this question, and the next
moment,<br>
breathless and agitated, he rode in among us.</p>

<p>"What is it? Are we attacked?"</p>

<p>"Would to Heaven that were all! But come along, lads, follow
me."</p>

<p>"What can it be, then?" said I again; while my anxiety knew no
bounds.</p>

<p>"Brennier has escaped; burst his way through Pack's Division,
and has<br>
already reached Valde Mula."</p>

<p>"The French have escaped!" was repeated from mouth to mouth;
while,<br>
pressing spurs to our horses, we broke into a gallop, and dashed
forward in<br>
the direction of the musketry. We soon came up with the 36th
Infantry, who,<br>
having thrown away their knapsacks, were rapidly pressing the
pursuit. The<br>
maledictions which burst from every side proved how severely the
misfortune<br>
was felt by all, while the eager advance of the men bespoke how
ardently<br>
they longed to repair the mishap.</p>

<p>Dark as was the night, we passed them in a gallop, when
suddenly the<br>
officer who commanded the leading squadron called out to
halt.</p>

<p>"Take care there, lads!" cried he; "I hear the infantry before
us; we shall<br>
be down upon our own people."</p>

<p>The words were hardly spoken, when a bright flash blazed out
before us, and<br>
a smashing volley was poured into the squadron.</p>

<p>"The French! the French, by Jove!" said Hampden. "Forward,
boys! charge<br>
them!"</p>

<p>Breaking into open order, to avoid our wounded comrades,
several of whom<br>
had fallen by the fire, we rode down among them. In a moment
their order<br>
was broken, their ranks pierced, and fresh squadrons coming up at
the<br>
instant, they were sabred to a man.</p>

<p>After this the French pursued their march in silence, and even
when<br>
assembling in force we rode down upon their squares, they never
halted nor<br>
fired a shot. At Barba del Puerco, the ground being unfit for
cavalry, the<br>
Thirty-sixth took our place, and pressed them hotly home. Several
of<br>
the French were killed, and above three hundred made prisoners,
but our<br>
fellows, following up the pursuit too rashly, came upon an
advanced body of<br>
Massena's force, drawn up to await and cover Brennier's retreat;
the result<br>
was the loss of above thirty men in killed and wounded.</p>

<p>Thus were the great efforts of the three preceding days
rendered fruitless<br>
and nugatory. To maintain this blockade, Lord Wellington, with an
inferior<br>
force, and a position by no means strong, had ventured to give
the enemy<br>
battle; and now by the unskilfulness of some, and the negligence
of others,<br>
were all his combinations thwarted, and the French general
enabled to march<br>
his force through the midst of the blockading columns almost
unmolested and<br>
uninjured.</p>

<p>Lord Wellington's indignation was great, as well it might be;
the prize for<br>
which he had contested was torn from his grasp at the very moment
he had<br>
won it, and although the gallantry of the troops in the pursuit
might,<br>
under other circumstances, have called forth eulogium, his only
observation<br>
on the matter was a half-sarcastic allusion to the inconclusive
effects of<br>
undisciplined bravery. "Notwithstanding," says the general order
of the<br>
day, "what has been printed in gazettes and newspapers, we have
never seen<br>
small bodies, unsupported, successfully opposed to large; nor has
the<br>
experience of any officer realized the stories which all have
read, of<br>
whole armies being driven by a handful of light infantry and
dragoons."</p>

<br><br><br><br><p>CHAPTER XXVI.</p>

<p>A NIGHT ON THE AZAVA.</p>

<p>Massena was now recalled, and Marmont, having assumed the
command of<br>
the French, army, retired towards Salamanca, while our troops
went into<br>
cantonments upon the Aguada. A period of inaction succeeded to
our previous<br>
life of bustle and excitement, and the whole interest of the
campaign was<br>
now centred in Beresford's army, exposed to Soult in
Estramadura.</p>

<p>On the 15th Lord Wellington set out for that province, having
already<br>
directed a strong force to march upon Badajos.</p>

<p>"Well, O'Malley," said Crawfurd, as he returned from bidding
Lord<br>
Wellington good-by, "your business is all right; the
commander-in-chief has<br>
signed my recommendation, and you will get your troop."</p>

<p>While I continued to express my grateful acknowledgments for
his kindness,<br>
the general, apparently inattentive to all I was saying, paced
the room<br>
with hurried steps, stopping every now and then to glance at a
large map of<br>
Spain which covered one wall of the apartment, while he muttered
to himself<br>
some broken and disjointed sentences.</p>

<p>"Eight leagues&mdash;too weak in cavalry&mdash;with the left upon Fuenta
Grenaldo&mdash;a<br>
strong position. O'Malley, you'll take a troop of dragoons and
patrol the<br>
country towards Castro; you'll reconnoitre the position the Sixth
Corps<br>
occupies, but avoid any collision with the enemy's pickets,
keeping the<br>
Azava between you and them. Take rations for three days."</p>

<p>"When shall I set out, sir?"</p>

<p>"Now!" was the reply.</p>

<p>Knowing with what pleasure the hardy veteran recognized
anything like<br>
alacrity and despatch, I resolved to gratify him; and before half
an hour<br>
had elapsed, was ready with my troop to receive his final
orders.</p>

<p>"Well done, boy!" said he, as he came to the door of the hut,
"you've lost<br>
no time. I don't believe I have any further instructions to give
you; to<br>
ascertain as far as possible the probable movement of the enemy
is my<br>
object, that's all." As he spoke this, he waved his hand, and
wishing me<br>
"Good-by," walked leisurely back into the house. I saw that his
mind was<br>
occupied by other thoughts; and although I desired to obtain some
more<br>
accurate information for my guidance, knowing his dislike to
questions, I<br>
merely returned his salute, and set forth upon my journey.</p>

<p>The morning was beautiful; the sun had risen about an hour,
and the earth,<br>
refreshed by the heavy dew of the night, was breathing forth all
its<br>
luxuriant fragrance. The river which flowed beside us was clear
as crystal,<br>
showing beneath its eddying current the shining, pebbly bed,
while upon<br>
the surface, the water-lilies floated or sank as the motion of
the stream<br>
inclined. The tall cork-trees spread their shadows about us, and
the richly<br>
plumed birds hopped from branch to branch awaking the echoes with
their<br>
notes.</p>

<p>It is but seldom that the heart of man is thoroughly attuned
to the<br>
circumstances of the scenery around him. How often do we need a
struggle<br>
with ourselves to enjoy the rich and beautiful landscape which
lies smiling<br>
in its freshness before us! How frequently do the blue sky and
the calm air<br>
look down upon the heart darkened and shadowed with affliction!
And how<br>
often have we felt the discrepancy between the lowering look of
winter and<br>
the glad sunshine of our hearts! The harmony of the world without
with our<br>
thoughts within is one of the purest, as it is one of the
greatest, sources<br>
of happiness. Our hopes and our ambitions lose their selfish
character when<br>
we feel that fortune smiles upon us from all around, and the
flattery which<br>
speaks to our hearts from the bright stars and the blue sky, the
peaked<br>
mountain or the humble flower, is greater in its mute eloquence
than all<br>
the tongue of man can tell us.</p>

<p>This feeling did I experience in all its fulness as I
ruminated upon my<br>
bettered fortunes, and felt within myself that secret instinct
that tells<br>
of happiness to come. In such moods of mind my thoughts strayed
ever<br>
homewards, and I could not help confessing how little were all my
successes<br>
in my eyes, did I not-hope for the day when I should pour forth
my tale of<br>
war and battle-field to the ears of those who loved me.</p>

<p>I resolved to write home at once to my uncle. I longed to tell
him each<br>
incident of my career, and my heart glowed as I thought over the
broken<br>
and disjointed sentences which every cotter around would whisper
of my<br>
fortunes, far prouder as they would be in the humble deeds of one
they<br>
knew, than in the proudest triumphs of a nation's glory.</p>

<p>Indeed, Mike himself gave the current to my thoughts. After
riding beside<br>
me for some time in silence, he remarked,&mdash;</p>

<p>"And isn't it Father Rush will be proud when he sees your
honor's a<br>
captain; to think of the little boy that he used to take before
him on the<br>
ould gray mare for a ride down the avenue,&mdash;to think of him being
a real<br>
captain, six feet two without his boots, and galloping over the
French as<br>
if they were lurchers! Peggy Mahon, that nursed you, will be the
proud<br>
woman the day she hears it; and there won't be a soldier sober in
his<br>
quarters that night in Portumna barracks! 'Pon my soul, there's
not a thing<br>
with a red coat on it, if it was even a scarecrow to frighten the
birds<br>
from the barley, that won't be treated with respect when they
hear of the<br>
news."</p>

<p>The country through which we travelled was marked at every
step by the<br>
traces of a retreating army: the fields of rich corn lay
flattened beneath<br>
the tramp of cavalry, or the wheels of the baggage-wagons; the
roads, cut<br>
up and nearly impassable, were studded here and there with marks
which<br>
indicated a bivouac. At the same time, everything around bore a
very<br>
different aspect from what we had observed in Portugal; there,
the<br>
vindictive cruelty of the French soldiery had been seen in full
sway: the<br>
ruined ch&acirc;teau, the burned villages, the desecrated altars,
the murdered<br>
peasantry,&mdash;all attested the revengeful spirit of a beaten and
baffled<br>
enemy. No sooner, however, had they crossed the frontiers, than,
as if by<br>
magic, their character became totally changed. Discipline and
obedience<br>
succeeded to recklessness and pillage; and instead of treating
the natives<br>
with, inhumanity and cruelty, in all their intercourse with the
Spaniards<br>
the French behaved with moderation and even kindness. Paying
for<br>
everything, obtaining their billets peaceably and quietly,
marching with<br>
order and regularity, they advanced into the heart of the
country, showing,<br>
by the most irrefragable proof, the astonishing evidences of a
discipline<br>
which, by a word, could convert the lawless irregularities of a
ruffian<br>
soldiery into the orderly habits and obedient conduct of a
highly-organized<br>
army.</p>

<p>As we neared the Azava, the tracks of the retiring enemy
became gradually<br>
less perceptible, and the country, uninjured by the march,
extended for<br>
miles around us in all the richness and abundance of a favored
climate. The<br>
tall corn, waving its yellow gold, reflected like a sea the
clouds that<br>
moved slowly above it. The wild gentian and the laurel grew
thickly around,<br>
and the cattle stood basking in the clear streams, while some
listless<br>
peasant lounged upon the bank beside them. Strange as all these
evidences<br>
of peace and tranquillity were, so near to the devastating track
of a<br>
mighty army, yet I have more than once witnessed the fact, and
remarked<br>
how, but a short distance from the line of our hurried march, the
country<br>
lay untouched and uninjured; and though the clank of arms and the
dull roll<br>
of the artillery may have struck upon the ear of the far-off
dweller in his<br>
native valley, he listened as he would have done to the passing
thunder as<br>
it crashed above him; and when the bright sky and pure air
succeeded to<br>
the lowering atmosphere and the darkening storm, he looked forth
upon his<br>
smiling fields and happy home, while he muttered to his heart a
prayer of<br>
thanksgiving that the scourge was passed.</p>

<p>We bivouacked upon the bank of the river, a truly Salvator
Rosa scene;<br>
the rocks, towering high above us, were fissured by the channel
of many a<br>
trickling stream, seeking, in its zigzag current, the bright
river below.<br>
The dark pine-tree and the oak mingled their foliage with the
graceful<br>
cedar, which spread its fan-like branches about us. Through the
thick shade<br>
some occasional glimpses of a starry sky could yet be seen, and a
faint<br>
yellow streak upon the silent river told that the queen of night
was there.</p>

<p>When I had eaten my frugal supper, I wandered forth alone upon
the bank<br>
of the stream, now standing to watch its bold sweeps as it
traversed the<br>
lonely valley before me, now turning to catch a passing glance at
our<br>
red watch-fires and the hardy features which sat around. The
hoarse and<br>
careless laugh, the deep-toned voice of some old campaigner
holding forth<br>
his tale of flood and field, were the only sounds I heard; and
gradually I<br>
strolled beyond the reach of even these. The path beside the
river, which<br>
seemed scarped from the rock, was barely sufficient for the
passage of<br>
one man, a rude balustrade of wood being the only defence against
the<br>
precipice, which, from a height of full thirty feet, looked down
upon the<br>
stream. Here and there some broad gleam of moonlight would fall
upon the<br>
opposite bank, which, unlike the one I occupied, stretched out
into rich<br>
meadow and pasturage, broken by occasional clumps of ilex and
beech. River<br>
scenery has been ever a passion with me. I can glory in the bold
and broken<br>
outline of a mighty mountain; I can gaze with delighted eyes upon
the<br>
boundless seas, and know not whether to like it more in all the
mighty<br>
outpouring of its wrath, when the white waves lift their heads to
heaven<br>
and break themselves in foam upon the rocky beach, or in the calm
beauty of<br>
its broad and mirrored surface, in which the bright world of sun
and sky<br>
are seen full many a fathom deep. But far before these, I love
the happy<br>
and tranquil beauty of some bright river, tracing its winding
current<br>
through valley and through plain, now spreading into some calm
and waveless<br>
lake, now narrowing to an eddying stream with mossy rocks and
waving trees<br>
darkening over it. There's not a hut, however lowly, where the
net of the<br>
fisherman is stretched upon the sward, around whose hearth I do
not picture<br>
before me the faces of happy toil and humble contentment, while,
from the<br>
ruined tower upon the crag, methinks I hear the ancient sounds of
wassail<br>
and of welcome; and though the keep be fissured and the curtain
fallen, and<br>
though for banner there "waves some tall wall-flower," I can
people its<br>
crumbling walls with images of the past; and the merry laugh of
the warder,<br>
and the clanking tread of the mailed warrior, are as palpably
before me as<br>
the tangled lichen that now trails from its battlements.</p>

<p>As I wandered on, I reached the little rustic stair which led
downward from<br>
the path to the river's side; and on examining farther, perceived
that at<br>
this place the stream was fordable; a huge flat rock, filling up
a great<br>
part of the river's bed, occupied the middle, on either side of
which the<br>
current ran with increased force.</p>

<p>Bent upon exploring, I descended the cliff, and was preparing
to cross,<br>
when my attention was attracted by the twinkle of a fire at some
distance<br>
from me, on the opposite side; the flame rose and fell in fitful
flashes,<br>
as though some hand were ministering to it at the moment. As it
was<br>
impossible, from the silence on every side, that it could proceed
from a<br>
bivouac of the enemy, I resolved on approaching it, and examining
it for<br>
myself. I knew that the shepherds in remote districts were
accustomed thus<br>
to pass the summer nights, with no other covering save the blue
vault above<br>
them. It was not impossible, too, that it might prove a Guerilla
party, who<br>
frequently, in small numbers, hang upon the rear of a retreating
army. Thus<br>
conjecturing, I crossed the stream, and quickening my pace,
walked forward<br>
in the direction of the blaze. For a moment a projecting rock
obstructed my<br>
progress; and while I was devising some means of proceeding
farther, the<br>
sound of voices near me arrested my attention. I listened, and
what was my<br>
astonishment to hear that they spoke in French. I now crept
cautiously to<br>
the verge of the rock and looked over; the moon was streaming in
its full<br>
brilliancy upon a little shelving strand beside the stream, and
here I<br>
now beheld the figure of a French officer. He was habited in the
undress<br>
uniform of a <i>chasseur &aacute; cheval</i>, but wore no arms; indeed
his occupation<br>
at the moment was anything but a warlike one, he being leisurely
employed<br>
in collecting some flasks of champagne which apparently had been
left to<br>
cool within the stream.</p>

<p>"<i>Eh bien, Alphonse!</i>" said a voice in the direction of the
fire, "what are<br>
you delaying for?"</p>

<p>"I'm coming, I'm coming," said the other; "but, <i>par Dieu!</i> I
can only find<br>
five of our bottles; one seems to have been carried away by the
stream."</p>

<p>"No matter," replied the other, "we are but three of us, and
one is, or<br>
should be, on the sick list."</p>

<p>The only answer to this was the muttered chorus of a French
drinking-song,<br>
interrupted at intervals by an imprecation upon the missing
flask. It<br>
chanced, at this moment, that a slight clinking noise attracted
me, and on<br>
looking down, I perceived at the foot of the rock the prize he
sought for.<br>
It had been, as he conceived, carried away by an eddy of the
stream and was<br>
borne, as a true prisoner-of-war, within my grasp. I avow that
from this<br>
moment my interest in the scene became considerably heightened;
such a waif<br>
as a bottle of champagne was not to be despised in circumstances
like mine;<br>
and I watched with anxious eyes every gesture of the impatient
Frenchman,<br>
and alternately vibrated between hope and fear, as he neared or
receded<br>
from the missing flask.</p>

<p>"Let it go to the devil," shouted his companion, once more.
"Jacques has<br>
lost all patience with you."</p>

<p>"Be it so, then," said the other, as he prepared to take up
his burden. At<br>
this instant I made a slight effort so to change my position as
to obtain<br>
a view of the rest of the party. The branch by which I supported
myself,<br>
however, gave way beneath my grasp with a loud crash. I lost my
footing,<br>
and slipping downward from the rock, came plump into the stream
below. The<br>
noise, the splash, and more than all, the sudden appearance of a
man beside<br>
him, astounded the Frenchman, who almost let fall his pannier,
and thus we<br>
stood confronting each other for at least a couple of minutes in
silence. A<br>
hearty burst of laughter from both parties terminated this
awkward moment,<br>
while the Frenchman, with the readiness of his country, was the
first to<br>
open the negotiation.</p>

<p>"<i>Sacr&eacute; Dieu!</i>" said he, "what can you be doing here?
You're English,<br>
without doubt."</p>

<p>"Even so," said I; "but that is the very question I was about
to ask you;<br>
what are you doing here?"</p>

<p>"<i>Eh bien</i>," replied the other, gayly, "you shall be answered
in all<br>
frankness. Our captain was wounded in the action of the 8th, and
we heard<br>
had been carried up the country by some peasants. As the army
fell back, we<br>
obtained permission to go in search of him. For two days all was
fruitless;<br>
the peasantry fled at our approach; and although we captured some
of our<br>
stolen property&mdash;among other things, the contents of this
basket&mdash;yet we<br>
never came upon the track of our comrade till this evening. A
good-hearted<br>
shepherd had taken him to his hut, and treated him with every
kindness,<br>
but no sooner did he hear the gallop of our horses and the clank
of our<br>
equipments, than, fearing himself to be made a prisoner, he fled
up the<br>
mountains, leaving our friend behind him; <i>voil&agrave; notre
histoire</i>. Here we<br>
are, three in all, one of us with a deep sabre-cut in his
shoulder. If you<br>
are the stronger party, we are, I suppose, your prisoners; if
not&mdash;"</p>

<p>What was to have followed I know not, for at this moment his
companion, who<br>
had finally lost all patience, came suddenly to the spot.</p>

<p>"A prisoner," cried he, placing a heavy hand upon my shoulder,
while with<br>
the other he held his drawn sword pointed towards my breast.</p>

<p>To draw a pistol from my bosom was the work of a second; and
while gently<br>
turning the point of his weapon away, I coolly said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Not so fast, my friend, not so fast! The game is in my hands,
not yours. I<br>
have only to pull this trigger, and my dragoons are upon you;
whatever fate<br>
befall me, yours is certain."</p>

<p>A half-scornful laugh betrayed the incredulity of him I
addressed, while<br>
the other, apparently anxious to relieve the awkwardness of the
moment,<br>
suddenly broke in with,&mdash;</p>

<p>"He is right, Auguste, and you are wrong; we are in his power;
that is,"<br>
added he, smiling, "if he believes there is any triumph in
capturing such<br>
<i>pauvres diables</i> as ourselves."</p>

<p>The features of him he addressed suddenly lost their scornful
expression,<br>
and sheathing his sword with an air of almost melodramatic
solemnity,<br>
he gravely pulled up his mustaches, and after a pause of a few
seconds,<br>
solemnly ejaculated a malediction upon his fortune.</p>

<p>"<i>C'est toujours ainsi</i>," said he, with a bitterness that only
a Frenchman<br>
can convey when cursing his destiny. "<i>Soyez bon enfant</i>, and see
what will<br>
come of it. Only be good-natured, only be kind, and if you
haven't bad luck<br>
at the end of it, it's only because fortune has a heavier stroke
in reserve<br>
for you hereafter."</p>

<p>I could not help smiling at the Frenchman's philosophy, which,
assuming<br>
as a good augury, he gayly said, "So, then, you'll not make us
prisoners.<br>
Isn't it so?"</p>

<p>"Prisoners," said the other, "nothing of the kind. Come and
sup with us;<br>
I'll venture to say our larder is as well stocked as your own; in
any case<br>
an omelette, a cold chicken, and a glass of champagne are not bad
things in<br>
our circumstances."</p>

<p>I could not help laughing outright at the strangeness of the
proposal.<br>
"I fear I must decline," said I; "you seem to forget I am placed
here to<br>
watch, not to join you."</p>

<p>"<i>A la bonne heure</i>," cried the younger of the two; "do both.
Come along;<br>
<i>soyez bon camarade</i>; you are always near your own people, so
don't refuse<br>
us."</p>

<p>In proportion as I declined, they both became more pressing in
their<br>
entreaties, and at last, I began to dread lest my refusal might
seem to<br>
proceed from some fear as to the good faith of the invitation,
and I never<br>
felt so awkwardly placed as when one plumply pressed me by
saying,&mdash;</p>

<p>"<i>Mais pourquoi pas, mon cher?</i>"</p>

<p>I stammered out something about duty and discipline, when they
both<br>
interrupted me by a long burst of laughter.</p>

<p>"Come, come!" said they; "in an hour&mdash;in half an hour, if you
will&mdash;you<br>
shall be back with your own people. We've had plenty of fighting
latterly,<br>
and we are likely to have enough in future; we know something of
each other<br>
by this time in the field; let us see how we get on in the
bivouac!"</p>

<p>Resolving not to be outdone in generosity, I replied at once,
"Here goes,<br>
then!"</p>

<p>Five minutes afterwards I found myself seated at their bivouac
fire. The<br>
captain, who was the oldest of the party, was a fine soldier-like
fellow of<br>
some forty years old; he had served in the Imperial Guard through
all the<br>
campaigns of Italy and Austria, and abounded in anecdotes of the
French<br>
army. From him I learned many of those characteristic traits
which so<br>
eminently distinguish the imperial troops, and saw how completely
their<br>
bravest and boldest feats of arms depended upon the personal
valor of him<br>
who led them on. From the daring enterprise of Napoleon at Lodi
to the<br>
conduct of the lowest corporal in the <i>grande arm&eacute;e</i>, the
picture presents<br>
nothing but a series of brilliant and splendid chivalry; while,
at the same<br>
time, the warlike character of the nation is displayed by that
instinctive<br>
appreciation of courage and daring which teaches them to follow
their<br>
officers to the very cannon's mouth.</p>

<p>"It was at Elchingen," said the captain, "you should have seen
them. The<br>
regiment in which I was a lieutenant was ordered to form close
column, and<br>
charge through a narrow ravine to carry a brigade of guns, which,
by a<br>
flanking fire, were devastating our troops. Before we could reach
the<br>
causeway, we were obliged to pass an open plain in which the
ground dipped<br>
for about a hundred yards; the column moved on, and though it
descended one<br>
hill, not a man ever mounted the opposite one. A very avalanche
of balls<br>
swept the entire valley; and yet amidst the thunder and the
smoke, the red<br>
glare of the artillery, and the carnage around them, our
grenadiers marched<br>
firmly up. At last, Marshal Ney sent an aide-de-camp with orders
to the<br>
troops to lie flat down, and in this position the artillery
played over<br>
us for above half an hour. The Austrians gradually slackened, and
finally<br>
discontinued their fire; this was the moment to resume the
attack. I crept<br>
cautiously to my knees and looked about. One word brought my men
around me;<br>
but I found to my horror that of a battalion who came into action
fourteen<br>
hundred strong, not five hundred remained; and that I myself, a
mere<br>
lieutenant, was now the senior officer of the regiment. Our
gallant colonel<br>
lay dead beside my feet. At this instant a thought struck me. I
remembered<br>
a habit he possessed in moments of difficulty and danger, of
placing in his<br>
shako a small red plume which he commonly carried in his belt. I
searched<br>
for it, and found it. As I held it aloft, a maddening cheer burst
around<br>
me, while from out the line each officer sprang madly forward,
and rushed<br>
to the head of the column. It was no longer a march. With a loud
cry of<br>
vengeance, the mass rushed forward, the men trying to outstrip
their<br>
officers, and come first in contact with the foe. Like tigers on
the<br>
spring, they fell upon the enemy, who, crushed, overwhelmed, and
massacred,<br>
lay in slaughtered heaps around the cannon. The cavalry of the
Guard came<br>
thundering on behind us; a whole division followed; and three
thousand five<br>
hundred prisoners, and fourteen pieces of artillery were
captured.</p>

<p>"I sat upon the carriage of a gun, my face begrimed with
powder, and my<br>
uniform blackened and blood-stained. The whole thing appeared
like some<br>
shocking dream. I felt a hand upon my shoulder, while a rough
voice called<br>
in my ear, '<i>Capitaine du soixante-neuvi&egrave;me, tu es mon
fr&egrave;re!</i>'</p>

<p>"It was Ney who spoke. This," added the brave captain, his
eyes filling as<br>
he said the words,&mdash;"this is the sabre he gave me."</p>

<p>I know not why I have narrated this anecdote; it has little in
itself, but<br>
somehow, to me it brings back in all its fulness the recollection
of that<br>
night.</p>

<p>There was something so strongly characteristic of the old
Napoleonist<br>
in the tone of his narrative that I listened throughout with
breathless<br>
attention. I began to feel too, for the first time, what a
powerful arm<br>
in war the Emperor had created by fostering the spirit of
individual<br>
enterprise. The field thus opened to fame and distinction left no
bounds<br>
to the ambition of any. The humble conscript, as he tore himself
from the<br>
embraces of his mother, wiped his tearful eyes to see before him
in the<br>
distance the b&acirc;ton of a marshal. The bold soldier who
stormed a battery<br>
felt his heart beat more proudly and more securely beneath the
cordon of<br>
the Legion than behind a cuirass of steel; and to a people in
whom the<br>
sense of duty alone would seem cold, barren, and inglorious, he
had<br>
substituted a highly-wrought chivalrous enthusiasm; and by the
<i>prestige</i><br>
of his own name, the proud memory of his battles, and the glory
of those<br>
mighty tournaments at which all Europe were the spectators, he
had<br>
converted a nation into an army.</p>

<p>By a silent and instinctive compact we appeared to avoid those
topics of<br>
the campaign in which the honor of our respective arms was
interested; and<br>
once, when, by mere accident, the youngest of the party adverted
to Fuentes<br>
d'Onoro, the old captain adroitly turned the current of the
conversation by<br>
saying, "Come, Alphonse, let's have a song."</p>

<p>"Yes," said the other. "<i>Les Pas de Charge</i>."</p>

<p>"No, no," said the captain; "if I am to have a choice, let it
be that<br>
little Breton song you gave us on the Danube."</p>

<p>"So be it then," said Alphonse. "Here goes!"</p>

<p>I have endeavored to convey, by a translation, the words he
sang; but I<br>
feel conscious how totally their feeling and simplicity are lost
when<br>
deprived of their own <i>patois</i>, and the wild but touching melody
that<br>
accompanied them.</p>

<p>    THE BRETON HOME.</p>

<p>    When the battle is o'er, and the sounds of fight<br>
    Have closed with the closing day,<br>
    How happy around the watch-fire's light<br>
    To chat the long hours away;<br>
    To chat the long hours away, my boy,<br>
    And talk of the days to come,<br>
    Or a better still and a purer joy,<br>
    To think of our far-off home.</p>

<p>    How many a cheek will then grow pale,<br>
    That never felt a tear!<br>
    And many a stalwart heart will quail,<br>
    That never quailed in fear!<br>
    And the breast that like some mighty rock<br>
    Amidst the foaming sea<br>
    Bore high against the battle's shock<br>
    Now heaves like infancy.</p>

<p>    And those who knew each other not<br>
    Their hands together steal,<br>
    Each thinks of some long hallowed spot,<br>
    And all like brothers feel:<br>
    Such holy thoughts to all are given;<br>
    The lowliest has his part;<br>
    The love of home, like love of heaven,<br>
    Is woven in our heart.</p>

<p>There was a pause as he concluded, each sank in his own
reflections. How<br>
long we should have thus remained, I know not; but we were
speedily aroused<br>
from our reveries by the tramp of horses near us. We listened,
and could<br>
plainly detect in their rude voices and coarse laughter the
approach of a<br>
body of Guerillas. We looked from one to the other in silence and
in fear.<br>
Nothing could be more unfortunate should we be discovered. Upon
this point<br>
we were left little time to deliberate; for with a loud cheer,
four Spanish<br>
horsemen galloped up to the spot, their carbines in the rest. The
Frenchmen<br>
sprang to their feet, and seized their sabres, bent upon making a
resolute<br>
resistance. As for me, my determination was at once taken.
Remaining<br>
quietly seated upon the grass, I stirred not for a moment, but
addressing<br>
him who appeared to be the chief of the Guerillas, said, in
Spanish:&mdash;</p>

<p>"These are my prisoners; I am a British officer of dragoons,
and my party<br>
is yonder."</p>

<p>This evidently unexpected declaration seemed to surprise them,
and they<br>
conferred for a few moments together. Meanwhile they were joined
by two<br>
others, in one of whom we could recognize, by his costume, the
real leader<br>
of the party.</p>

<p>"I am captain in the light dragoons," said I, repeating my
declaration.</p>

<p>"<i>Morte de Dios!</i>" replied he; "it is false; you are a
spy!"</p>

<p>The word was repeated from lip to lip by his party, and I saw,
in their<br>
lowering looks and darkened features, that the moment was a
critical one<br>
for me.</p>

<p>"Down with your arms!" cried he, turning to the Frenchmen.
"Surrender<br>
yourselves our prisoners; I'll not bid ye twice!"</p>

<p>The Frenchmen turned upon me an inquiring look, as though to
say that upon<br>
me now their hopes entirely reposed.</p>

<p>"Do as he bids you," said I; while at the same moment I sprang
to my legs,<br>
and gave a loud, shrill whistle, the last echo of which had not
died away<br>
in the distance ere it was replied to.</p>


<a name="0217"></a>
<img alt="0217.jpg (167K)" src="0217.jpg" height="1043" width="677">

<p>[THE TABLES TURNED.]</p>
<br><br>

<p>"Make no resistance now," said I to the Frenchmen; "our safety
depends on this."</p>

<p>While this was passing two of the Spaniards had dismounted,
and detaching a<br>
coil of rope which hung from their saddle-peak, were proceeding
to tie the<br>
prisoners wrist to wrist; the others, with their carbines to the
shoulder,<br>
covered us man by man, the chief of the party having singled out
me as his<br>
peculiar prey.</p>

<p>"The fate of Mascarenhas might have taught you better," said
he, "than to<br>
play this game." And then added with a grim smile, "But we'll see
if an<br>
Englishman will not make as good a carbonado as a
Portuguese!"</p>

<p>This cruel speech made my blood run cold, for I knew well to
what he<br>
alluded. I was at Lisbon at the time it happened, but the
melancholy fate<br>
of Julian Mascarenhas, the Portuguese spy, had reached me there.
He was<br>
burned to death at Torres Vedras!</p>

<p>The Spaniard's triumph over my terror was short-lived, indeed,
for scarcely<br>
had the words fallen from his lips, when a party of the
Fourteenth,<br>
dashing through the river at a gallop, came riding up. The
attitude of the<br>
Guerillas, as they sat with presented arms, was sufficient for my
fellows<br>
who needed not the exhortation of him who rode foremost of the
party:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Ride them down, boys! Tumble them over! Flatten their broad
beavers, the<br>
infernal thieves!"</p>

<p>"Whoop!" shouted Mike, as he rode at the chief with the force
of a<br>
catapult. Down went the Spaniard, horse and all; and before he
could<br>
disentangle himself, Mike was upon him, his knee pressed upon his
neck.</p>

<p>"Isn't it enough for ye to pillage the whole country without
robbing the<br>
king's throops!" cried he, as he held him fast to the earth with
one hand,<br>
while he presented a loaded pistol to his face.</p>

<p>By this time the scene around me was sufficiently ludicrous.
Such of the<br>
Guerillas as had not been thrown by force from their saddles, had
slid<br>
peaceably down, and depositing their arms upon the ground,
dropped upon<br>
their knees in a semicircle around us, and amidst the hoarse
laughter of<br>
the troopers, and the irrepressible merriment of the Frenchmen,
rose up the<br>
muttered prayers of the miserable Spaniards, who believed that
now their<br>
last hour was come.</p>

<p>"<i>Madre de Dios</i>, indeed!" cried Mike, imitating the tone of a
repentant<br>
old sinner in a patched mantle; "it's much the blessed Virgin
thinks of<br>
the like o' ye, thieves and rogues as ye are; it a'most puts me
beyond my<br>
senses to see ye there crossing yourselves like <i>rale</i>
Christians."</p>

<p>If I could not help indulging myself in this retributive
cruelty towards<br>
the chief, and leaving him to the tender mercies of Mike, I
ordered the<br>
others to rise and form in line before me. Affecting to occupy
myself<br>
entirely with them, I withdrew the attention of all from the
French<br>
officers, who remained quiet spectators of the scene around
them.</p>

<p>"<i>Point de fa&ccedil;ons</i>, gentlemen," said I, in a whisper.
"Get to your horses<br>
and away! Now's your time. Good-by!"</p>

<p>A warm grasp of the hand from each was the only reply, and I
turned once<br>
more to my discomforted friends the Guerillas.</p>

<p>"There, Mike, let the poor devil rise. I confess appearances
were strong<br>
against me just now."</p>

<p>"Well, Captain, are you convinced by this time that I was not
deceiving<br>
you?"</p>

<p>The Guerilla muttered some words of apology between his teeth,
and while he<br>
shook the dust from his cloak, and arranged the broken feather of
his<br>
hat, cast a look of scowling and indignant meaning upon Mike,
whose rough<br>
treatment he had evidently not forgiven.</p>

<p>"Don't be looking at me that way, you black thief! or
I'll&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hold there!" said I; "no more of this. Come, gentlemen, we
must be<br>
friends. If I mistake not, we've got something like refreshment
at our<br>
bivouac. In any case you'll partake of our watch-fire till
morning."</p>

<p>They gladly accepted our invitation, and ere half an hour
elapsed Mike's<br>
performance in the part of host had completely erased every
unpleasant<br>
impression his first appearance gave rise to; and as for myself,
when I did<br>
sleep at last, the confused mixture of Spanish and Irish airs
which issued<br>
from the thicket beside me, proved that a most intimate alliance
had grown<br>
up between the parties.</p>

<br><br><br><br><p>CHAPTER XXVII.</p>

<p>MIKE'S MISTAKE.</p>

<p>An hour before daybreak the Guerillas were in motion, and
having taken a<br>
most ceremonious leave of us, they mounted their horses and set
out upon<br>
their journey. I saw their gaunt figures wind down the valley,
and watched<br>
them till they disappeared in the distance. "Yes, brigands though
they be,"<br>
thought I, "there is something fine, something heroic in the
spirit of<br>
their unrelenting vengeance." The sleuth-hound never sought the
lair of<br>
his victim with a more ravening appetite for blood than they
track the<br>
retreating columns of the enemy. Hovering around the line of
march, they<br>
sometimes swoop down in masses, and carry off a part of the
baggage, or the<br>
wounded. The wearied soldier, overcome by heat and exhaustion,
who drops<br>
behind his ranks, is their certain victim; the sentry on an
advanced post<br>
is scarcely less so. Whole pickets are sometimes attacked and
carried off<br>
to a man; and when traversing the lonely passes of some mountain
gorge, or<br>
defiling through the dense shadows of a wooded glen, the stoutest
heart has<br>
felt a fear, lest from behind the rock that frowned above him, or
from the<br>
leafy thicket whose branches stirred without a breeze, the sharp
ring of a<br>
Guerilla carbine might sound his death-knell.</p>

<p>It was thus in the retreat upon Corunna fell Colonel Lefebvre.
Ever<br>
foremost in the attack upon our rear-guard, this gallant youth
(he was<br>
scarce six-and-twenty), a colonel of his regiment, and decorated
with the<br>
Legion of Honor, he led on every charge of his bold "<i>sabreurs</i>,"
riding<br>
up to the very bayonets of our squares, waving his hat above his
head, and<br>
seeming actually to court his death-wound; but so struck were our
brave<br>
fellows with his gallant bearing, that they cheered him as he
came on.</p>

<p>It was in one of these moments as, rising high in his
stirrups, he bore<br>
down upon the unflinching ranks of the British infantry, the
shrill whistle<br>
of a ball strewed the leaves upon the roadside, the exulting
shout of a<br>
Guerilla followed it, and the same instant Lefebvre fell forward
upon his<br>
horse's mane, a deluge of blood bursting from his bosom. A broken
cry<br>
escaped his lips,&mdash;a last effort to cheer on his men; his noble
charger<br>
galloped forward between our squares, bearing to us our prisoner,
the<br>
corpse of his rider.</p>

<p>"Captain O'Malley," said a mounted dragoon to the advanced
sentry at the<br>
bottom of the little hill upon which I was standing. "Despatches
from<br>
headquarters, sir," delivering into my hands a large sealed
packet from the<br>
adjutant-general's office. While he proceeded to search for
another letter<br>
of which he was the bearer, I broke the seal and read as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>    ADJUTANT-GENERAL'S OFFICE.</p>

<p>    May 15.</p>

<p>    Sir,&mdash;On the receipt of this order you are directed,
having previously<br>
    resigned your command to the officer next in seniority,
to<br>
    repair to headquarters at Fueutes d'Onoro, there to report
yourself<br>
    under arrest.</p>

<p>    I have the honor to be your obedient servant,</p>

<p>    GEORGE HOPETON,</p>

<p>    <i>Military Secretary</i>.</p>

<p>"What the devil can this mean?" said I to myself, as I read
the lines over<br>
again and again. "What have I done lately, or what have I left
undone to<br>
involve me in this scrape? Ah!" thought I, "to be sure, it can be
nothing<br>
else. Lord Wellington <i>did</i> recognize me that unlucky morning,
and has<br>
determined not to let me pass unpunished. How unfortunate.
Scarcely<br>
twenty-four hours have elapsed since fortune seemed to smile upon
me from<br>
every side, and now the very destiny I most dreaded stares me
fully in the<br>
face." A reprimand, or the sentence of a court-martial, I shrank
from with<br>
a coward's fear. It mattered comparatively little from what
source arising,<br>
the injury to my pride as a man and my spirit as a soldier would
be almost<br>
the same.</p>

<p>"This is the letter, sir," said the orderly, presenting me
with a packet,<br>
the address of which was in Power's hand-writing. Eagerly tearing
it open,<br>
I sought for something which might explain my unhappy position.
It bore the<br>
same date as the official letter, and ran thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>    My Dear Charley,&mdash;I joined yesterday, just in time to
enjoy the<br>
    heartiest laugh I have had since our meeting. If notoriety
can gratify<br>
    you, by Jove, you have it; for Charles O'Malley and his man
Mickey<br>
    Free are bywords in every mess from Villa Formosa to the
rear-guard.<br>
    As it's only fair you should participate a little in the fun
you've<br>
    originated, let me explain the cause. Your inimitable man
Mike, to<br>
    whom it appears you intrusted the report of killed and
wounded for<br>
    the adjutant-general, having just at that moment accomplished
a<br>
    letter to his friends at home, substituted his correspondence
for your<br>
    returns, and doubtless, sent the list of the casualties as
very<br>
    interesting information to his sweetheart in Ireland. If such
be the<br>
    case, I hope and trust she has taken the blunder in better
part than<br>
    old Colbourn, who swears he'll bring you to a court-martial,
under<br>
    Heaven knows what charges. In fact, his passion has known no
bounds<br>
    since the event; and a fit of jaundice has given his face a
kind of<br>
    neutral tint between green and yellow, like nothing I know of
except<br>
    the facings of the "dirty half-hundred." [2]</p>

<p>[Footnote 2: For the information of my unmilitary readers, I
may<br>
remark that this sobriquet was applied to the 50th Regiment.]</p>

<p>    As Mr. Free's letter may be as great a curiosity to you as
it has<br>
    been to us, I enclose you a copy of it, which Hopeton
obtained for<br>
    me. It certainly places the estimable Mike in a strong light
as a<br>
    despatch-writer. The occasional interruption to the current
of the<br>
    letter, you will perceive, arises from Mike having used the
pen of a<br>
    comrade, writing being, doubtless, an accomplishment
forgotten in<br>
    the haste of preparing Mr. Free for the world; and the
amanuensis<br>
    has, in more than one instance, committed to paper more than
was<br>
    meant by the author:&mdash;</p>

<p>      Mrs. M'Gra,&mdash;Tear an' ages, sure I need not be treating
he<br>
      way. Now, just say Mrs. Mary&mdash;ay, that'll do&mdash;Mrs. Mary,
it's may be<br>
      surprised you'll be to be reading a letter from your humble
servant,<br>
      sitting on the top of the Alps,&mdash;arrah, may be it's not the
Alps; but<br>
      sure she'll never know,&mdash;fornent the whole French army,
with Bony<br>
      himself and all his jinnerals&mdash;God be between us and
harm&mdash;ready to<br>
      murther every mother's son of us, av they were able, Molly
darlin';<br>
      but, with the blessing of Providence, and Lord Wellington
and Mister<br>
      Charles, we'll bate them yet, as we bate them afore.</p>

<p>      My lips is wathering at the thought o' the plunder. I
often<br>
      of Tim Riley, that was hanged for sheep-stealing; he'd be
worth his<br>
      weight in gold here.</p>

<p>      Mr. Charles is now a captain&mdash;devil a less&mdash;and myself
might be<br>
      somethin' that same, but ye see I was always of a bashful
n<br>
      and recommended the master in my place. "He's mighty young,
Mister<br>
      Charles is," says my Lord Wellington to me,&mdash;"He's mighty
young, Mr.<br>
      Free." "He is, my lord," says I; "he's young, as you
obsarve, but<br>
      he's as much divilment in him as many that might be his
father."<br>
      "That's somethin', Mr. Free," says my lord; "ye say he
comes from a<br>
      good stock?" "The <i>rale</i> sort, my lord," says I; "an ould,
ancient<br>
      family, that's spent every sixpence they had in treating
their<br>
      neighbors. My father lived near him for years,"&mdash;you see,
Molly, I<br>
      said that to season the discourse. "We'll make him a
captain," says<br>
      my lord; "but, Mr. Free, could we do nothing for you?"
"Nothing, at<br>
      present, my lord. When my friends comes into power," says
I, "they'll<br>
      think of me. There's many a little thing to give away in
Ireland, and<br>
      they often find it mighty hard to find a man for
lord-lieutenant; and<br>
      if that same, or a tide-waiter's place was vacant&mdash;" "Just
tell me,"<br>
      says my lord. "It's what I'll do," says I. "And now,
wishing you<br>
      happy dreams, I'll take my lave." Just so, Molly, it's hand
and glove<br>
      we are. A pleasant face, agreeable manners seasoned with
natural<br>
      modesty, and a good pair of legs, them's the gifts to push
a man's<br>
      way in the world. And even with the ladies&mdash;but sure I am
forgetting,<br>
      my master was proposed for, and your humble servant too, by
two<br>
      illigant creatures in Lisbon; but it wouldn't do, Molly,
it's higher<br>
      nor that we'll be looking,&mdash;<i>rale</i> princesses, the devil a
less. Tell<br>
      Kitty Hannigan I hope she's well; she was a disarving
young<br>
      in her situation in life. Shusey Dogherty, at the cross
roa<br>
      I don't forget the name&mdash;was a good-looking slip too; give
her my<br>
      affectionate salutations, as we say in the Portuguese. I
hope I'll be<br>
      able to bear the inclementuous nature of your climate when
I go back;<br>
      but I can't expect to stay long&mdash;for Lord Wellington can't
do without<br>
      me. We play duets on the guitar together every evening. The
master is<br>
      shouting for a blanket, so no more at present from,</p>

<p>      Your very affectionate friend,</p>

<p>      MICKEY FREE.</p>

<p>      P. S.&mdash;I don't write this myself, for the Spanish tongue
p<br>
      out o' the habit of English. Tell Father Rush, if he'd
study the<br>
      Portuguese, I'd use my interest for him with the Bishop of
Toledo.<br>
      It's a country he'd like&mdash;no regular stations, but
promiscuous eating<br>
      and drinking, and as pretty girls as ever confessed their
sins.</p>

<p>    My poor Charley, I think I am looking at you. I think I
can<br>
    see the struggle between indignation, and laughter, which
every line<br>
    of this letter inflicts upon you. Get back as quickly as you
can, and<br>
    we'll try if Crawfurd won't pull you through the business. In
any<br>
    case, expect no sympathy; and if you feel disposed to be
angry with<br>
    all who laugh at you, you had better publish a challenge in
the next<br>
    general order. George Scott, of, the Greys, bids me say, that
if<br>
    you're hard up for cash, he'll give you a couple of hundred
for<br>
    Mickey Free. I told him I thought you'd accept it, as your
uncle<br>
    has the breed of those fellows upon his estate, and might
have no<br>
    objection to weed his stud. Hammersley's gone back with the
Dashwoods;<br>
    but I don't think you need fear anything in that quarter.<br>
    At the same time, if you wish for success, make a bold push
for the<br>
    peerage and half-a-dozen decorations, for Miss Lucy is most
decidedly<br>
    gone wild about military distinction. As for me, my affairs
go on<br>
    well: I've had half-a-dozen quarrels with Inez, but we parted
good<br>
    friends, and my bad Portuguese has got me out of all
difficulties with<br>
    papa, who pressed me tolerably close as to fortune. I shall
want<br>
    your assistance in this matter yet. If parchments will
satisfy him, I<br>
    think I could get up a qualification; but somehow the matter
must<br>
    be done, for I'm resolved to have his daughter.</p>

<p>    The orderly is starting, so no more till we meet.</p>

<p>    Yours ever,            FRED POWER.</p>

<p>"Godwin," said I, as I closed the letter, "I find myself in a
scrape at<br>
headquarters; you are to take the command of the detachment, for
I must set<br>
out at once."</p>

<p>"Nothing serious, I hope. O'Malley?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no; nothing of consequence. A most absurd blunder of my
rascally<br>
servant."</p>

<p>"The Irish fellow yonder?"</p>

<p>"The same."</p>

<p>"He seems to take it easily, however."</p>

<p>"Oh, confound him! he does not know what trouble he has
involved me in; not<br>
that he'll care much when he does."</p>

<p>"Why, he does not seem to be of a very desponding temperament.
Listen to<br>
the fellow! I'll be hanged, if he's not singing!"</p>

<p>"I'm devilishly disposed to spoil his mirth. They tell me,
however, he<br>
always keeps the troop in good humor; and see, the fellows are
actually<br>
cleaning his horses for him, while he is sitting on the
bank!"</p>

<p>"Faith, O'Malley, that fellow knows the world. Just hear
him."</p>

<p>Mr. Free was, as described, most leisurely reposing on a bank,
a mug of<br>
something drinkable beside him, and a pipe of that curtailed
proportion<br>
which an Irishman loves held daintily between his fingers. He
appeared to<br>
be giving his directions to some soldiers of the troop, who were
busily<br>
cleaning his horses and accoutrements for him.</p>

<p>[MR. FREE PIPES WHILE HIS FRIENDS
PIPE-CLAY.]</p>
<br><br>

<p>"That's it, Jim! Rub 'em down along the hocks; he won't kick;
it's only<br>
play. Scrub away, honey; that's the devil's own carbine to get
clean."</p>

<p>"Well, I say, Mr. Free, are you going to give us that ere
song?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I'll be danged if I burnish your sabre, if you don't
sing."</p>

<p>"Tear an' ages! ain't I composing it? Av I was Tommy Moore, I
couldn't be<br>

<p>"Well, come along, my hearty; let's hear it."</p>

<p>"Oh, murther!" said Mike, draining the pot to its last few
drops, which he<br>
poured pathetically upon the grass before him; and then having
emptied the<br>
ashes from his pipe, he heaved a deep sigh, as though to say life
had no<br>
pleasures in store for him. A brief pause followed, after which,
to the<br>
evident delight of his expectant audience, he began the following
song, to<br>
the popular air of "Paddy O'Carroll":&mdash;</p>

<p>    BAD LUCK TO THIS MARCHING.</p>

<p>    Air,&mdash;<i>Paddy O'Carroll</i>.</p>

<p>    Bad luck to this marching,<br>
    Pipe-claying, and starching,<br>
    How neat one must be to be killed by the French,<br>
    I'm sick of parading,<br>
    Through wet and cowld wading,<br>
    Or standing all night to be shot in a trench.<br>
    To the tune of a fife<br>
    They dispose of your life,<br>
    You surrender your soul to some illigant lilt;<br>
    Now, I like Garryowen,<br>
    When I hear it at home,<br>
    But it's not half so sweet when you're going to be kilt.</p>

<p>    Then, though up late and early,<br>
    Our pay comes so rarely,<br>
    The devil a farthing we've ever to spare;<br>
    They say some disaster<br>
    Befell the paymaster;<br>
    On my conscience, I think that the money's not there.<br>
    And just think what a blunder,<br>
    They won't let us plunder,<br>
    While the convents invite us to rob them, 'tis clear;<br>
    Though there isn't a village,<br>
    But cries, "Come and pillage,"<br>
    Yet we leave all the mutton behind for Mounseer.</p>

<p>    Like a sailor that's nigh land,<br>
    I long for that island<br>
    Where even the kisses we steal if we please;<br>
    Where it is no disgrace<br>
    If you don't wash your face,<br>
    And you've nothing to do but to stand at your ease.<br>
    With no sergeant t'abuse us,<br>
    We fight to amuse us;<br>
    Sure, it's better bate Christians than kick a baboon.<br>
    How I'd dance like a fairy<br>
    To see ould Dunleary,<br>
    And think twice ere I'd leave it to be a dragoon!</p>

<p>"There's a sweet little bit for you," said Mike, as he
concluded; "thrown<br>
off as aisy as a game at football."</p>

<p>"I say, Mr. Free, the captain's looking for you; he's just
received<br>
despatches from the camp, and wants his horses."</p>

<p>"In that case, gentlemen, I must take my leave of you; with
the more<br>
regret, too, that I was thinking of treating you to a supper this
evening.<br>
You needn't be laughing; it's in earnest I am. Coming, sir,
coming!"<br>
shouted he, in a louder tone, answering some imaginary call, as
an excuse<br>
for his exit.</p>

<p>When he appeared before me, an air of most business-like
alacrity had<br>
succeeded to his late appearance, and having taken my orders to
get the<br>
horses in readiness, he left me at once, and in less than half an
hour we<br>
were upon the road.</p>

<br><br><br><br><p>CHAPTER XXVIII.</p>

<p>MONSOON IN TROUBLE.</p>

<p>As I rode along towards Fuentes d'Onoro, I could not help
feeling provoked<br>
at the absurd circumstances in which I was involved. To be made
the subject<br>
of laughter for a whole army was by no means a pleasant
consideration; but<br>
what I felt far worse was the possibility that the mention of my
name in<br>
connection with a reprimand might reach the ears of those who
knew nothing<br>
of the cause.</p>

<p>Mr. Free himself seemed little under the influence of similar
feelings; for<br>
when, after a silence of a couple of hours, I turned suddenly
towards him<br>
with a half-angry look, and remarked, "You see, sir, what your
confounded<br>
blundering has done," his cool reply was,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Ah, then! won't Mrs. M'Gra be frightened out of her life when
she reads<br>
all about the killed and wounded in your honor's report? I wonder
if they<br>
ever had the manners to send my own letter afterwards, when they
found out<br>
their mistake!"</p>

<p>"<i>Their</i> mistake, do you say? rather <i>yours!</i> You appear to
have a happy<br>
knack of shifting blame from your own shoulders. And do you fancy
that<br>
they've nothing else to do than to trouble their heads about your
absurd<br>
letters?"</p>

<p>"Faith, it's easily seen you never saw my letter, or you
wouldn't be saying<br>
that. And sure, it's not much trouble it would give Colonel
Fitzroy or any<br>
o' the staff that write a good hand just to put in a line to Mrs.
M'Gra, to<br>
prevent her feeling alarmed about that murthering paper. Well,
well; it's<br>
God's blessing! I don't think there's anybody of the name of
Mickey Free<br>
high up in the army but myself; so that the family won't be going
into<br>
mourning for me on a false alarm."</p>

<p>I had not patience to participate in this view of the case; so
that I<br>
continued my journey without speaking. We had jogged along for
some time<br>
after dark, when the distant twinkle of the-watch-fires announced
our<br>
approach to the camp. A detachment of the Fourteenth formed the
advanced<br>
post, and from the officer in command I learned that Power was
quartered<br>
at a small mill about half a mile distant; thither I accordingly
turned my<br>
steps, but finding that the path which led abruptly down to it
was broken<br>
and cut up in many places, I sent Mike back with the horses, and
continued<br>
my way alone on foot.</p>

<p>The night was deliciously calm; and as I approached the little
rustic mill,<br>
I could not help feeling struck with Power's taste in a
billet.</p>

<p>A little vine-clad cottage, built close against a rock, nearly
concealed<br>
by the dense foliage around it, stood beside a clear rivulet
whose eddying<br>
current supplied water to the mill, and rose in a dew-like spray
which<br>
sparkled like gems in the pale moonlight. All was still within,
but as I<br>
came nearer I thought I could detect the chords of a guitar. "Can
it be,"<br>
thought I, "that Master Fred has given himself up to minstrelsy;
or is<br>
it some little dress rehearsal for a serenade? But no," thought
I, "that<br>
certainly is not Power's voice." I crept stealthily down the
little path,<br>
and approached the window; the lattice lay open, and as the
curtain waved<br>
to and fro with the night air, I could see plainly all who were
in the<br>
room.</p>

<p>Close beside the window sat a large, dark-featured Spaniard,
his hands<br>
crossed upon his bosom and his head inclined heavily forward, the
attitude<br>
perfectly denoting deep sleep, even had not his cigar, which
remained<br>
passively between his lips, ceased to give forth its blue smoke
wreath. At<br>
a little distance from him sat a young girl, who, even by the
uncertain<br>
light, I could perceive was possessed of all that delicacy of
form and<br>
gracefulness of carriage which characterize her nation.</p>

<p>Her pale features&mdash;paler still from the contrast with her jet
black<br>
hair and dark costume&mdash;were lit up with an expression of
animation and<br>
enthusiasm as her fingers swept rapidly and boldly across the
strings of a<br>
guitar.</p>

<p>"And you're not tired of it yet?" said she, bending her head
downwards<br>
towards one whom I now for the first time perceived.</p>

<p>Reclining carelessly at her feet, his arm leaning upon her
chair, while his<br>
hand occasionally touched her taper fingers, lay my good friend,
Master<br>
Fred Power. An undress jacket, thrown loosely open, and a black
neck-cloth,<br>
negligently knotted, bespoke the easy <i>nonchalance</i> with which
he<br>
prosecuted his courtship.</p>

<p>"Do sing it again?" said he, pressing her fingers to his
lips.</p>

<p>What she replied, I could not catch; but Fred resumed: "No,
no; he never<br>
wakes. The infernal clatter of that mill is his lullaby."</p>

<p>"But your friend will be here soon," said she. "Is it not
so?"</p>

<p>"Oh, poor Charley! I'd almost forgotten him. By-the-bye, you
mustn't fall<br>
in love with him. There now, do not look angry; I only meant
that, as I<br>
knew he'd be desperately smitten, you shouldn't let him fancy he
got any<br>
encouragement."</p>

<p>"What would you have me do?" said she, artlessly.</p>

<p>"I have been thinking over that, too. In the first place,
you'd better<br>
never let him hear you sing; scarcely ever smile; and as far as
possible,<br>
keep out of his sight."</p>

<p>"One would think, Senhor, that all these precautions were to
be taken more<br>
on my account than on his. Is he so very dangerous, then?"</p>

<p>"Not a bit of it! Good-looking enough he is, but, only a boy;
at the same<br>
time, a devilish bold one! And he'd think no more of springing
through that<br>
window and throwing his arms round your neck, the very first
moment of his<br>
arrival, than I should of whispering how much I love you."</p>

<p>"How very odd he must be! I'm sure I should like him."</p>

<p>"Many thanks to both for your kind hints; and now to take
advantage of<br>
them." So saying, I stepped lightly upon the window-sill, cleared
the<br>
miller with one spring, and before Power could recover his legs
or<br>
Margeritta her astonishment, I clasped her in my arms, and kissed
her on<br>
either cheek.</p>

<p>"Charley! Charley! Damn it, man, it won't do!" cried Fred;
while the young<br>
lady, evidently more amused at his discomfiture than affronted at
the<br>
liberty, threw herself into a seat, and laughed immoderately.</p>

<p>"Ha! Hilloa there! What is't?" shouted the miller, rousing
himself from his<br>
nap, and looking eagerly round. "Are they coming? Are the French
coming?"</p>

<p>A hearty renewal of his daughter's laughter was the only
reply; while Power<br>
relieved his anxiety by saying,&mdash;</p>

<p>"No, no, Pedrillo, not the French; a mere marauding
party,&mdash;nothing more. I<br>
say, Charley," continued he, in a lower tone, "you had better
lose no time<br>
in reporting yourself at headquarters. We'll walk up together.
Devilish<br>
awkward scrape, yours."</p>

<p>"Never fear, Fred; time enough for all that. For the present,
if you permit<br>
me, I'll follow up my acquaintance with our fair friend
here."</p>

<p>"Gently, gently!" said he, with a look of most imposing
seriousness. "Don't<br>
mistake her; she's not a mere country girl: you understand?&mdash;been
bred in a<br>
convent here,&mdash;rather superior kind of thing."</p>

<p>"Come, come, Fred, I'm not the man to interfere with you for a
moment."</p>

<p>"Good-night, Senhor," said the old miller, who had been
waiting patiently<br>
all this time to pay his respects before going.</p>

<p>"Yes, that's it!" cried Power, eagerly. "Good-night,
Pedrillo."</p>

<p>"<i>Buonos noches</i>," lisped out Margeritta, with a slight
curtsy.</p>

<p>I sprang forward to acknowledge her salutation, when Power
coolly<br>
interposed between us, and closing the door after them, placed
his back<br>
against it.</p>

<p>"Master Charley, I must read you a lesson&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You inveterate hypocrite, don't attempt this nonsense with
<i>me</i>. But come,<br>
tell me how long you have been here?"</p>

<p>"Just twenty-four of the shortest hours I ever passed at an
outpost. But<br>
listen,&mdash;do you know that voice? Isn't it O'Shaughnessy?"</p>

<p>"To be sure it is. Hear the fellow's song."</p>

<p>    "My father cared little for shot or shell,<br>
    He laughed at death and dangers;<br>
    And he'd storm the very gates of hell<br>
    With a company of the 'Rangers.'<br>
    So sing tow, row, row, row, row," etc.</p>

<p>"Ah, then, Mister Power, it's twice I'd think of returning
your visit, if I<br>
knew the state of your avenue. If there's a grand jury in Spain,
they might<br>
give you a presentment for this bit of road. My knees are as bare
as a<br>
commissary's conscience, and I've knocked as much flesh off my
shin-bones<br>
as would make a cornet in the hussars!"</p>

<p>A regular roar of laughter from both of us apprized Dennis of
our vicinity.</p>

<p>"And it's laughing ye are? Wouldn't it be as polite just to
hold a candle<br>
or lantern for me in this confounded watercourse?"</p>

<p>"How goes it, Major?" cried I, extending my hand to him
through the window.</p>

<p>"Charley&mdash;Charley O'Malley, my son! I'm glad to see you. It's
a hearty<br>
laugh you gave us this morning. My friend Mickey's a pleasant
fellow for a<br>
secretary-at-war. But it's all settled now; Crawfurd arranged it
for you<br>
this afternoon."</p>

<p>"You don't say so! Pray tell me all about it."</p>

<p>"That's just what I won't; for ye see I don't know it; but I
believe old<br>
Monsoon's affair has put everything out of their heads."</p>

<p>"Monsoon's affair! What is that? Out with it, Dennis."</p>

<p>"Faith, I'll be just as discreet about that as your own
business. All I can<br>
tell you is, that they brought him up to headquarters this
evening with<br>
a sergeant's guard, and they say he's to be tried by
court-martial; and<br>
Picton is in a blessed humor about it."</p>

<p>"What could it possibly have been? Some plundering affair,
depend on it."</p>

<p>"Faith, you may swear it wasn't for his little charities, as
Dr. Pangloss<br>
calls them, they've pulled him up," cried Power.</p>

<p>"Maurice is in high feather about it," said Dennis. "There are
five of them<br>
up at Fuentes, making a list of the charges to send to Monsoon;
for Bob<br>
Mahon, it seems, heard of the old fellow's doings up the
mountains."</p>

<p>"What glorious fun!" said Tower. "Let's haste and join them,
boys."</p>

<p>"Agreed," said I. "Is it far from this?"</p>

<p>"Another stage. When we've got something to eat," said the
major, "if Power<br>
has any intentions that way&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, I really did begin to fear Fred's memory was lapsing;
but somehow,<br>
poor fellow, smiles have been more in his way than sandwiches
lately."</p>

<p>An admonishing look from Power was his only reply, as he
walked towards the<br>
door. Bent upon teasing him, however, I continued,&mdash;</p>

<p>"My only fear is, he may do something silly."</p>

<p>"Who? Monsoon, is it?"</p>

<p>"No, no. Not Monsoon; another friend of ours."</p>

<p>"Faith, I scarcely thought your fears of old Monsoon were
called for. He's<br>
a fox&mdash;the devil a less."</p>

<p>"No, no, Dennis. I wasn't thinking of him. My anxieties were
for a most<br>
soft-hearted young gentleman,&mdash;one Fred Power."</p>

<p>"Charley, Charley!" said Fred, from the door, where he had
been giving<br>
directions to his servant about supper. "A man can scarce do a
more silly<br>
thing than marry in the army; all the disagreeables of married
life, with<br>
none of its better features."</p>

<p>"Marry&mdash;marry!" shouted O'Shaughnessy, "upon my conscience,
it's<br>
incomprehensible to me how a man can be guilty of it. To be sure,
I don't<br>
mean to say that there are not circumstances,&mdash;such as half-pay,
old age,<br>
infirmity, the loss of your limbs, and the like; but that, with
good health<br>
and a small balance at your banker's, you should be led into such
an<br>
embarrassment&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Men will flirt," said I, interrupting; "men will press taper
fingers, look<br>
into bright eyes, and feel their witchery; and although the fair
owners be<br>
only quizzing them half the time, and amusing themselves the
other, and<br>
though they be the veriest hackneyed coquettes&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Did you ever meet the Dalrymple girls, Dennis?" said Fred,
with a look I<br>
shall never forget.</p>

<p>What the reply was I cannot tell. My shame and confusion were
overwhelming,<br>
and Power's victory complete.</p>

<p>"Here comes the prog," cried Dennis, as Power's servant
entered with a very<br>
plausible-looking tray, while Fred proceeded to place before us a
strong<br>
army of decanters.</p>

<p>Our supper was excellent, and we were enjoying ourselves to
the utmost,<br>
when an orderly sergeant suddenly opened the door, and raising
his hand to<br>
his cap, asked if Major Power was there.</p>

<p>"A letter for you, sir."</p>

<p>"Monsoon's writing, by Jove! Come, boys, let us see what it
means. What a<br>
hand the old fellow writes! The letters look all crazy, and are
tumbling<br>
against each other on every side. Did you ever see anything half
so tipsy<br>
as the crossing of that <i>t?</i>"</p>

<p>"Read it. Read it out, Fred!"</p>

<p>    Tuesday Evening.</p>

<p>    Dear Power,&mdash;I'm in such a scrape! Come up and see me
at<br>
    once, bring a little sherry with you, and we'll talk over
what's to be<br>
    done.</p>

<p>    Yours ever,</p>

<p>    B. MONSOON.</p>

<p>    Quarter-General.</p>

<p>We resolved to finish our evening with the major; so that,
each having<br>
armed himself with a bottle or two, and the remnants of our
supper, we set<br>
out towards his quarters, under the guidance of the orderly.
After a sharp<br>
walk of half an hour, we reached a small hut, where two sentries
of the<br>
Eighty-eighth were posted at the door.</p>

<p>O'Shaughnessy procured admittance for us, and in we went. At a
small table,<br>
lighted by a thin tallow candle, sat old Monsoon, who, the
weather being<br>
hot, had neither coat nor wig on; an old cracked china tea-pot,
in which<br>
as we found afterwards he had mixed a little grog, stood before
him, and a<br>
large mass of papers lay scattered around on every side,&mdash;he
himself being<br>
occupied in poring over their contents, and taking occasional
draughts from<br>
his uncouth goblet.</p>

<p>As we entered noiselessly, he never perceived us, but
continued to mumble<br>
over, in a low tone, from the documents before him:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Upon my life, it's like a dream to me! What infernal stuff
this brandy<br>
is!"</p>

<p>    CHARGE No. 8.&mdash;For conduct highly unbecoming an officer
and<br>
    a gentleman, in forcing the cellar of the San Nicholas
convent at<br>
    Banos, taking large quantities of wine therefrom, and
subsequently<br>
    compelling the prior to dance a bolero, thus creating a riot,
and<br>
    tending to destroy the harmony between the British and the
Portuguese,<br>
    so strongly inculcated to be preserved by the general
orders.</p>

<p>"Destroy the harmony! Bless their hearts! How little they know
of it! I've<br>
never passed a jollier night in the Peninsula! The prior's a
trump, and<br>
as for the bolero, he <i>would</i> dance it. I hope they say nothing
about my<br>
hornpipe."</p>

<p>    CHARGE No. 9.&mdash;For a gross violation of his duty as an
officer, in<br>
    sending a part of his brigade to attack and pillage the
alcalde of<br>
    Banos; thereby endangering the public peace of the town,
being a<br>
    flagrant breach of discipline and direct violation of the
articles of<br>
    war.</p>

<p>"Well, I'm afraid I was rather sharp on the alcalde, but we
did him no harm<br>
except the fright. What sherry the fellow had! 't would have been
a sin to<br>
let it fall into the hands of the French."</p>

<p>    CHARGE No. 10.&mdash;For threatening, on or about the night of
the<br>
    3d, to place the town of Banos under contribution, and
subsequently<br>
    forcing the authorities to walk in procession before him, in
absurd<br>
    and ridiculous costumes.</p>

<p>"Lord, how good it was! I shall never forget the old alcalde!
One of my<br>
fellows fastened a dead lamb round his neck, and told him it was
the golden<br>
fleece. The commander-in-chief would have laughed himself if he
had been<br>
there. Picton's much too grave,&mdash;never likes a joke."</p>

<p>    CHARGE No. 11.&mdash;For insubordination and disobedience, in
refusing<br>
    to give up his sword, and rendering it necessary for the
Portuguese<br>
    guard to take it by force,&mdash;thereby placing himself in a<br>
    situation highly degrading to a British officer.</p>

<p>"Didn't I lay about me before they got it! Who's that? Who's
laughing<br>
there? Ah, boys, I'm glad to see you! How are you, Fred? Well,
Charley,<br>
I've heard of your scrape; very sad thing for so young a fellow
as you are.<br>
I don't think you'll be broke; I'll do what I can. I'll see what
I can do<br>
with Picton; we are very old friends, were at Eton together."</p>

<p>"Many thanks, Major; but I hear your own affairs are not
flourishing.<br>
What's all this court-martial about?"</p>

<p>"A mere trifle; some little insubordination in the legion.
Those Portuguese<br>
are sad dogs. How very good of you, Fred, to think of that little
supper."</p>

<p>While the major was speaking, his servant, with a dexterity
the fruit of<br>
long habit, had garnished the table with the contents of our
baskets, and<br>
Monsoon, apologizing for not putting on his wig, sat down among
us with a<br>
face as cheerful as though the floor was not covered with the
charges of<br>
the court-martial to be held on him.</p>

<p>As we chatted away over the campaign and its chances, Monsoon
seemed little<br>
disposed to recur to his own fortunes. In fact, he appeared to
suffer much<br>
more from what he termed my unlucky predicament than from his own
mishaps.<br>
At the same time, as the evening wore on, and the sherry began to
tell upon<br>
him, his heart expanded into its habitual moral tendency, and by
an easy<br>
transition, he was led from the religious association of convents
to the<br>
pleasures of pillaging them.</p>

<p>"What wine they have in their old cellars! It's such fun
drinking it out of<br>
great silver vessels as old as Methuselah. 'There's much treasure
in the<br>
house of the righteous,' as David says; and any one who has ever
sacked a<br>
nunnery knows that."</p>

<p>"I should like to have seen that prior dancing the bolero,"
said Power.</p>

<p>"Wasn't it good, though! He grew jealous of me, for I
performed a hornpipe.<br>
Very good fellow the prior; not like the alcalde,&mdash;there was no
fun in him.<br>
Lord bless him! he'll never forget me."</p>

<p>"What did you do with him, Major?"</p>

<p>"Well, I'll tell you; but you mustn't let it be known, for I
see they have<br>
not put it in the court-martial. Is there no more sherry there?
There, that<br>
will do; I'm always contented. 'Better a dry morsel with
quietness,' as<br>
Moses says. Ay, Charley, never forget that 'a merry heart is just
like<br>
medicine.' Job found out that, you know."</p>

<p>"Well, but the alcalde, Major."</p>

<p>"Oh! the alcalde, to be sure. These pious meditations make me
forget<br>
earthly matters."</p>

<p>"This old alcalde at Banos, I found out, was quite spoiled by
Lord<br>
Wellington. He used to read all the general orders, and got an
absurd<br>
notion in his head that because we were his allies, we were not
allowed to<br>
plunder. Only think, he used to snap his fingers at Beresford,
didn't care<br>
twopence about the legion, and laughed outright at Wilson. So,
when I was<br>
ordered down there, I took another way with him. I waited till
night-fall,<br>
ordered two squadrons to turn their jackets, and sent forward one
of my<br>
aides-de-camp, with a few troopers, to the alcalde's house. They
galloped<br>
into the courtyard, blowing trumpets and making an infernal
hubbub. Down<br>
came the alcalde in a passion. 'Prepare quarters quickly, and
rations for<br>
eight hundred men.'</p>

<p>"'Who dares to issue such an order?' said he.</p>

<p>"The aide-de-camp whispered one word in his ear, and the old
fellow<br>
grew pale as death. 'Is he here; is he coming,&mdash;is he coming?'
said he,<br>
trembling from head to foot.</p>

<p>"I rode in myself at this moment looking thus,&mdash;</p>

<p>"'<i>O&ugrave; est le malheureux?</i>' said I, in French,&mdash;you know
I speak French like<br>
Portuguese."</p>

<p>"Devilish like, I've no doubt," muttered Power.</p>

<p>"'<i>Pardon, gracias eccellenza!</i>' said the alcalde, on his
knees."</p>

<p>"Who the deuce did he take you for, Major?"</p>

<p>"You shall hear; you'll never guess, though. Lord, I shall
never forget it!<br>
He thought I was Marmont; my aide-de-camp told him so."</p>

<p>One loud burst of laughter interrupted the major at this
moment, and it was<br>
some considerable time before he could continue his
narrative.</p>

<p>"And do you really mean," said I, "that you personated the
Duke de Raguse?"</p>

<p>"Did I not, though? If you had only seen me with a pair of
great mustaches,<br>
and a drawn sabre in my hand, pacing the room up and down in
presence of<br>
the assembled authorities. Napoleon himself might have been
deceived. My<br>
first order was to cut off all their heads; but I commuted the
sentence<br>
to a heavy fine. Ah, boys, if they only understood at
headquarters how to<br>
carry on a war in the Peninsula, they'd never have to grumble in
England<br>
about increased taxation! How I'd mulet the nunneries! How I'd
grind the<br>
corporate towns! How I'd inundate the country with exchequer
bills! I'd<br>
sell the priors at so much a head, and put the nuns up to auction
by the<br>
dozen."</p>

<p>"You sacrilegious old villain! But continue the account of
your exploits."</p>

<p>"Faith, I remember little more. After dinner I grew somewhat
mellow, and<br>
a kind of moral bewilderment, which usually steals over me about
eleven<br>
o'clock, induced me to invite the alcalde and all the aldermen to
come and<br>
sup. Apparently, we had a merry night of it, and when morning
broke,<br>
we were not quite clear in our intellects. Hence came that
infernal<br>
procession; for when the alcalde rode round the town with a paper
cap, and<br>
all the aldermen after him, the inhabitants felt offended, it
seems, and<br>
sent for a large Guerilla force, who captured me and my staff,
after a very<br>
vigorous resistance. The alcalde fought like a trump for us, for
I promised<br>
to make him Prefect of the Seine; but we were overpowered,
disarmed, and<br>
carried off. The remainder you can read in the court-martial, for
you may<br>
think that after sacking the town, drinking all night, and
fighting in the<br>
morning, my memory was none of the clearest."</p>

<p>"Did you not explain that you were not the
marshal-general?"</p>

<p>"No, faith, I know better than that; they'd have murdered me
had they known<br>
their mistake. They brought me to headquarters in the hope of a
great<br>
reward, and it was only when they reached this that they found
out I<br>
was not the Duke de Raguse; so you see, boys, it's a very
complicated<br>
business."</p>

<p>"'Gad, and so it is," said Power, "and an awkward one,
too."</p>

<p>"He'll be hanged, as sure as my name's Dennis!" vociferated
O'Shaughnessy,<br>
with an energy that made the major jump from his chair. "Picton
will hang<br>
him!"</p>

<p>"I'm not afraid," said Monsoon; "they know me so well. Lord
bless you,<br>
Beresford couldn't get on without me!"</p>

<p>"Well, Major," said I, "in any case, you certainly take no
gloomy nor<br>
desponding view of your case."</p>

<p>"Not I, boy. You know what Jeremiah says: 'a merry heart is a
continual<br>
feast;' and so it is. I may die of repletion, but they'll never
find me<br>
starved with sorrow."</p>

<p>"And, faith, it's a strange thing!" muttered O'Shaughnessy,
thinking aloud;<br>
"a most extraordinary thing! An honest fellow would be sure to be
hanged;<br>
and there's that old rogue, that's been melting down more saints
and<br>
blessed Virgins than the whole army together, he'll escape. Ye'll
see he<br>
will!"</p>

<p>"There goes the patrol," said Fred; "we must start."</p>

<p>"Leave the sherry, boys; you'll be back again. I'll have it
put up<br>
carefully."</p>

<p>We could scarcely resist a roar of laughter as we said,
"Good-night."</p>

<p>"Adieu, Major," said I; "we shall meet soon."</p>

<p>So saying, I followed Power and O'Shaughnessy towards their
quarters.</p>

<p>"Maurice has done it beautifully!" said Power. "Pleasant
revelations the<br>
old fellow will make on the court-martial, if he only remembers
what we've<br>
heard to-night! But here we are, Charley; so good-night, and
remember, you<br>
breakfast with me to-morrow."</p>

<br><br><br><br><p>CHAPTER XXIX.</p>

<p>THE CONFIDENCE.</p>

<p>"I have changed the venue, Charley," said Power, as he came
into my room<br>
the following morning,&mdash;"I've changed the venue, and come to
breakfast with<br>
you."</p>

<p>I could not help smiling as a certain suspicion crossed my
mind; perceiving<br>
which, he quickly added,&mdash;</p>

<p>"No, no, boy! I guess what you're thinking of. I'm not a bit
jealous in<br>
that quarter. The fact is, you know, one cannot be too
guarded."</p>

<p>"Nor too suspicious of one's friends, apparently."</p>

<p>"A truce with quizzing. I say, have you reported
yourself?"</p>

<p>"Yes; and received this moment a most kind note from the
general. But it<br>
appears I'm not destined to have a long sojourn among you, for
I'm desired<br>
to hold myself in readiness for a journey this very day."</p>

<p>"Where the deuce are they going to send you now?"</p>

<p>"I'm not certain of my destination. I rather suspect there are
despatches<br>
for Badajos. Just tell Mike to get breakfast, and I'll join
you<br>
immediately."</p>

<p>When I walked into the little room which served as my <i>salon</i>,
I found<br>
Power pacing up and down, apparently wrapped in meditation.</p>

<p>"I've been thinking, Charley," said he, after a pause of about
ten<br>
minutes,&mdash;"I've been thinking over our adventures in Lisbon.
Devilish<br>
strange girl that senhora! When you resigned in my favor, I took
it for<br>
granted that all difficulty was removed. Confound it! I no sooner
began to<br>
profit by your absence, in pressing my suit, than she turned
short round,<br>
treated me with marked coldness, exhibited a hundred wilful and
capricious<br>
fancies, and concluded one day by quietly confessing to me you
were the<br>
only man she cared for."</p>

<p>"You are not serious in all this, Fred?" said I.</p>

<p>"Ain't I though, by Jove! I wish to Heaven I were not! My dear
Charley,<br>
the girl is an inveterate flirt,&mdash;a decided coquette. Whether she
has a<br>
particle of heart or not, I can't say; but certainly her greatest
pleasure<br>
is to trifle with that of another. Some absurd suspicion that you
were in<br>
love with Lucy Dashwood piqued her vanity, and the anxiety to
recover a<br>
lapsing allegiance led her to suppose herself attached to you,
and made her<br>
treat all my advances with the most frigid indifference or
wayward caprice;<br>
the more provoking," continued he, with a kind of bitterness in
his tone,<br>
"as her father was disposed to take the thing favorably; and, if
I must say<br>
it, I felt devilish spooney about her myself.</p>

<p>"It was only two days before I left, that in a conversation
with Don<br>
Emanuel, he consented to receive my addresses to his daughter on
my<br>
becoming lieutenant-colonel. I hastened back with delight to
bring her the<br>
intelligence, and found her with a lock of hair on the book
before her,<br>
over which she was weeping. Confound me, if it was not yours! I
don't<br>
know what I said, nor what she replied; but when we parted, it
was with a<br>
perfect understanding we were never to meet again. Strange girl!
She came<br>
that evening, put her arm within mine as I was walking alone in
the garden,<br>
and half in jest, half in earnest, talked me out of all my
suspicions, and<br>
left me fifty times more in love with her than ever. Egad! I
thought I used<br>
to know something about women, but here is a chapter I've yet to
read.<br>
Come, now, Charley, be frank with me; tell me all you know."</p>

<p>"My poor Fred, if you were not head and ears in love, you
would see as<br>
plainly as I do that your affairs prosper. And after all, how
invariable<br>
is it that the man who has been the veriest flirt with
women,&mdash;sighing,<br>
serenading, sonneteering, flinging himself at the feet of every
pretty girl<br>
he meets with,&mdash;should become the most thorough dupe to his own
feelings<br>
when his heart is really touched. Your man of eight-and-thirty is
always<br>
the greatest fool about women."</p>

<p>"Confound your impertinence! How the devil can a fellow with a
mustache not<br>
stronger that a Circassian's eyebrow read such a lecture to
<i>me?</i>"</p>

<p>"Just for the very reason you've mentioned. You <i>glide</i> into
an attachment<br>
at <i>my</i> time of life; you <i>fall</i> in love at <i>yours</i>."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Power, musingly, "there is some truth in that.
This flirting is<br>
sad work. It is just like sparring with a friend; you put on the
gloves in<br>
perfect good humor, with the most friendly intentions of
exchanging a few<br>
amicable blows; you find yourself insensibly warm with the
enthusiasm of<br>
the conflict, and some unlucky hard knock decides the matter, and
it ends<br>
in a downright fight.</p>

<p>"Few men, believe me, are regular seducers; and among those
who behave<br>
'vilely' (as they call it), three-fourths of the number have been
more<br>
sinned against than sinning. You adventure upon love as upon a
voyage to<br>
India. Leaving the cold northern latitudes of first acquaintance
behind<br>
you, you gradually glide into the warmer and more genial climate
of<br>
intimacy. Each day you travel southward shortens the miles and
the hours of<br>
your existence; so tranquil is the passage, and so easy the
transition, you<br>
suffer no shock by the change of temperature about you. Happy
were it for<br>
us that in our courtship, as in our voyage, there were some
certain Rubicon<br>
to remind us of the miles we have journeyed! Well were it if
there were<br>
some meridian in love!"</p>

<p>"I'm not sure, Fred, that there is not that same shaving
process they<br>
practise on the line, occasionally performed for us by parents
and<br>
guardians at home; and I'm not certain that the iron hoop of old
Neptune is<br>
not a pleasanter acquaintance than the hair-trigger of some
indignant<br>
and fire-eating brother. But come, Fred, you have not told me the
most<br>
important point,&mdash;how fare your fortunes now; or in other words,
what are<br>
your present prospects as regards the senhora?"</p>

<p>"What a question to ask me! Why not request me to tell you
where Soult will<br>
fight us next, and when Marmont will cross the frontier? My dear
boy, I<br>
have not seen her for a week, an entire week,&mdash;seven full days
and nights,<br>
each with their twenty-four hours of change and vacillation."</p>

<p>"Well, then, give me the last bulletin from the seat of war;
that at least<br>
you can do. Tell me how you parted."</p>

<p>"Strangely enough. You must know we had a grand dinner at the
villa the<br>
day before I left; and when we adjourned for our coffee to the
garden, my<br>
spirits were at the top of their bent. Inez never looked so
beautiful,<br>
never was one half so gracious; and as she leaned upon my arm,
instead<br>
of following the others towards the little summer-house, I
turned, as if<br>
inadvertently, into a narrow, dark alley that skirts the
lake."</p>

<p>"I know it well; continue."</p>

<p>Power reddened slightly, and went on:&mdash;</p>

<p>"'Why are we taking this path?' said Donna Inez; 'this is,
surely, not a<br>
short way?'</p>

<p>"'Oh, I wished to make my adieux to my old friends the swans.
You know I go<br>
to-morrow.'</p>

<p>"'Ah, that's true,' added she. 'I'd quite forgotten it.'</p>

<p>"This speech was not very encouraging; but as I felt myself in
for the<br>
battle, I was not going to retreat at the skirmish. 'Now or
never,' thought<br>
I. I'll not tell you what I said. I couldn't, if I would. It is
only with<br>
a pretty woman upon one's arm; it is only when stealing a glance
at her<br>
bright eyes, as you bend beyond the border of her bonnet,&mdash;that
you know<br>
what it is to be eloquent. Watching the changeful color of her
cheek with<br>
a more anxious heart than ever did mariner gaze upon the fitful
sky above<br>
him, you pour out your whole soul in love; you leave no time for
doubt, you<br>
leave no space for reply. The difficulties that shoot across her
mind you<br>
reply to ere she is well conscious of them; and when you feel her
hand<br>
tremble, or see her eyelids fall, like the leader of a storming
party when<br>
the guns slacken in their fire, you spring boldly forward in the
breach,<br>
and blind to every danger around you, rush madly on, and plant
your<br>
standard upon the walls."</p>

<p>"I hope you allow the vanquished the honors of war," said I,
interrupting.</p>

<p>Without noticing my observation, he continued:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I was on my knee before her, her hand passively resting in
mine, her eyes<br>
bent <i>upon</i> me softly and tearfully&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The game was your own, in fact."</p>

<p>"You shall hear.</p>

<p>"'Have we stood long enough thus, Senhor?' said she, bursting
into a fit of<br>
laughter.</p>

<p>"I sprang to my legs in anger and indignation.</p>

<p>"'There, don't be passionate; it is so tiresome. What do you
call that tree<br>
there?'</p>

<p>"'It is a tulip-tree,' said I, coldly.</p>

<p>"'Then, to put your gallantry to the test, do climb up there
and pluck me<br>
that flower. No, the far one. If you fall into the lake and are
drowned,<br>
why it would put an end to this foolish interview.'</p>

<p>"'And if not?' said I.</p>

<p>"'Oh, then I shall take twelve hours to consider of it; and if
my decision<br>
be in your favor, I'll give you the flower ere you leave
to-morrow.'</p>

<p>"It's somewhat about thirty years since I went bird-nesting,
and hang me,<br>
if a tight jacket and spurs are the best equipment for climbing a
tree; but<br>
up I went, and, amidst a running fire of laughter and quizzing,
reached the<br>
branch and brought it down safely.</p>

<p>"Inez took especial care to avoid me the rest of the evening.
We did not<br>
meet until breakfast the following morning. I perceived then that
she wore<br>
the flower in her belt; but, alas! I knew her too well to augur
favorably<br>
from that; besides that, instead of any trace of sorrow or
depression at my<br>
approaching departure, she was in high spirits, and the life of
the party.<br>
'How can I manage to speak with her?' said I to myself. 'But one
word,&mdash;I<br>
already anticipate what it must be; but let the blow
fall&mdash;anything is<br>
better than this uncertainty.'</p>

<p>"'The general and the staff have passed the gate, sir,' said
my servant at<br>
this moment.</p>

<p>"'Are my horses ready?'</p>

<p>"'At the door, sir; and the baggage gone forward.'</p>

<p>"I gave Inez one look&mdash;</p>

<p>"'Did you say more coffee?' said she, smiling.</p>

<p>"I bowed coldly, and rose from the table. They all assembled
upon the<br>
terrace to see me ride away.</p>

<p>"'You'll let us hear from you,' said Don Emanuel.</p>

<p>"'And pray don't forget the letter to my brother,' cried old
Madame Forjas.</p>

<p>"Twenty similar injunctions burst from the party, but not a
word said Inez.</p>

<p>"'Adieu, then!' said I. 'Farewell.'</p>

<p>"'Adios! Go with God!' chorused the party.</p>

<p>"'Good-by, Senhora,' said I. 'Have <i>you</i> nothing to tell me
ere we part?'</p>

<p>"'Not that I remember,' said she, carelessly. 'I hope you'll
have good<br>
weather.'</p>

<p>"'There is a storm threatening,' said I, gloomily.</p>

<p>"'Well, a soldier cares little for a wet jacket.'</p>

<p>"'Adieu!' said I, sharply, darting at her a look that spoke my
meaning.</p>

<p>"'Farewell!' repeated she, curtsying slightly, and giving one
of her<br>
sweetest smiles.</p>

<p>"I drove the spurs into my horse's flanks, but holding him
firmly on the<br>
curb at the same moment, instead of dashing forward, he bounded
madly in<br>
the air.</p>

<p>"'What a pretty creature!' said she, as she turned towards the
house; then<br>
stopping carelessly, she looked round,&mdash;</p>

<p>"'Should you like this bouquet?'</p>

<p>"Before I could reply, she disengaged it from her belt, and
threw it<br>
towards me. The door closed behind her as she spoke. I galloped
on to<br>
overtake the staff, <i>et voil&agrave; tout</i>. Now, Charley, read my
fate for me, and<br>
tell me what this portends."</p>

<p>"I confess I only see one thing certain in the whole."</p>

<p>"And that is?" said Power.</p>

<p>"That Master Fred Power is more irretrievably in love than any
gentleman on<br>
full pay I ever met with."</p>

<p>"By Jove, I half fear as much! Is that orderly waiting for
you, Charley?<br>
Who do you want my man?"</p>

<p>"Captain O'Malley, sir. General Crawfurd desires to see you at
headquarters<br>
immediately."</p>

<p>"Come, Charley, I'm going towards Fuentes. Take your cap;
we'll walk down<br>
together."</p>

<p>So saying, we cantered towards the village, where we
separated,&mdash;Power to<br>
join some Fourteenth men stationed there on duty, and I to the
general's<br>
quarters to receive my orders.</p>

<br><br><br><br><p>CHAPTER XXX.</p>

<p>THE CANTONMENT.</p>

<p>Soon after this the army broke up from Caja, and went into
cantonments<br>
along the Tagus, the headquarters being at Portalegre. We were
here joined<br>
by four regiments of infantry lately arrived from England, and
the 12th<br>
Light Dragoons. I shall not readily forget the first impression
created<br>
among our reinforcements by the habits of our life at this
period.</p>

<p>[A HUNTING TURN-OUT IN THE PENINSULA.]</p>
<br><br>

<p>Brimful of expectation, they had landed at Lisbon, their minds
filled with<br>
all the glorious expectancy of a brilliant campaign; sieges,
storming, and<br>
battle-fields floated before their excited imagination.
Scarcely,<br>
however, had they reached the camp, when these illusions were
dissipated.<br>
Breakfasts, dinners, private theatricals, pigeon matches, formed
our daily<br>
occupation. Lord Wellington's hounds threw off regularly twice a
week;<br>
and here might be seen every imaginable species of equipment,
from the<br>
artillery officer mounted on his heavy troop horse, to the
infantry<br>
subaltern on a Spanish jennet. Never was anything more ludicrous
than our<br>
turn-out. Every quadruped in the army was put into requisition.
And even<br>
those who rolled not from their saddles from sheer necessity,
were most<br>
likely to do so from laughing at their neighbors. The pace may
not have<br>
equalled Melton, nor the fences have been as stubborn as in
Leicestershire,<br>
but I'll be sworn there was more laughter, more fun, and more
merriment,<br>
in one day with us, than in a whole season with the best
organized pack in<br>
England. With a lively trust that the country was open and the
leaps easy,<br>
every man took the field. Indeed, the only anxiety evinced at
all, was to<br>
appear at the meet in something like jockey fashion, and I must
confess<br>
that this feeling was particularly conspicuous among the
infantry. Happy<br>
the man whose kit boasted a pair of cords or buck skins; thrice
happy he<br>
who sported a pair of tops. I myself was in that enviable
position, and<br>
well remember with what pride of heart I cantered up to cover in
all the<br>
superior <i>&eacute;clat</i> of my costume, though, if truth were to
be spoken, I doubt<br>
if I should have passed muster among my friends of the "Blazers."
A round<br>
cavalry jacket and a foraging cap with a hanging tassel were the
strange<br>
accompaniments of my more befitting nether garments. Whatever our
costumes,<br>
the scene was a most animated one. Here the shell-jacket of a
heavy dragoon<br>
was seen storming the fence of a vineyard; there the dark green
of a<br>
rifleman was going the pace over the plain. The unsportsmanlike
figure of<br>
a staff officer might be observed emerging from a drain, while
some<br>
neck-or-nothing Irishman, with light infantry wings, was flying
at every<br>
fence before him, and overturning all in his way. The rules and
regulations<br>
of the service prevailed not here; the starred and gartered
general, the<br>
plumed and aiguilletted colonel obtained but little deference and
less<br>
mercy from his more humble subaltern. In fact, I am half disposed
to think<br>
that many an old grudge of rigid discipline or severe duty met
with its<br>
retribution here. More than once have I heard the muttered
sentences around<br>
me which boded like this,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Go the pace, Harry, never flinch it! There's old
Colquhoun&mdash;take him in<br>
the haunches; roll him over!"</p>

<p>"See here, boys&mdash;watch how I'll scatter the staff&mdash;Beg your
pardon,<br>
General, hope I haven't hurt you. Turn about&mdash;fair play&mdash;I have
taught<br>
<i>you</i> to take up a position now."</p>

<p>I need scarcely say there was one whose person was sacred from
all such<br>
attacks. He was well mounted upon a strong, half-breed horse;
rode always<br>
foremost, following the hounds with the same steady pertinacity
with which<br>
he would have followed the enemy, his compressed lip rarely
opening for a<br>
laugh when even the most ludicrous misadventure was enacting
before him;<br>
and when by chance he would give way, the short ha! ha! was over
in a<br>
moment, and the cold, stern features were as fixed and impassive
as before.</p>

<p>All the excitement, all the enthusiasm of a hunting-field,
seemed powerless<br>
to turn his mind from the pre-occupation which the mighty
interests he<br>
presided over, exacted. I remember once an incident which,
however trivial<br>
in itself, is worth recording as illustrative of what I mean. We
were going<br>
along at a topping pace, the hounds, a few fields in advance,
were hidden<br>
from our view by a small beech copse. The party consisted of not
more than<br>
six persons, one of whom was Lord Wellington himself. Our run had
been a<br>
splendid one, and as we were pursuing the fox to earth, every man
of us<br>
pushed his horse to his full stride in the hot enthusiasm of such
a moment.</p>

<p>"This way, my lord, this way," said Colonel Conyers, an old
Melton man, who<br>
led the way. "The hounds are in the valley; keep to the left." As
no reply<br>
was made, after a few moments' pause Conyers repeated his
admonition, "You<br>
are wrong, my lord, the hounds are hunting yonder."</p>

<p>"I know it!" was the brief answer given, with a shortness that
almost<br>
savored of asperity; for a second or two not a word was
spoken.</p>

<p>"How far is Niza, Gordon?" inquired Lord Wellington.</p>

<p>"About five leagues, my lord," replied the astonished
aide-de-camp.</p>

<p>"That's the direction, is it not?"</p>

<p>"Yes, my lord."</p>

<p>"Let's go over and inspect the wounded."</p>

<p>No more was said, and before a second was given for
consideration, away<br>
went his lordship, followed by his aide-de-camp, his pace the
same<br>
stretching gallop, and apparently feeling as much excitement, as
he dashed<br>
onwards towards the hospital, as though following in all the
headlong<br>
enthusiasm of a fox chase.</p>

<p>Thus passed our summer; a life of happy ease and recreation
succeeding to<br>
the harassing fatigues and severe privations of the preceding
campaign.<br>
Such are the lights and shadows of a soldier's life; such the
checkered<br>
surface of his fortunes. Constituting, by their very change, that
buoyant<br>
temperament, that happy indifference, which enables him to derive
its full<br>
enjoyment from each passing incident of his career.</p>

<p>While thus we indulged in all the fascinations of a life of
pleasure, the<br>
rigid discipline of the army was never for a moment forgotten.
Reviews,<br>
parades, and inspections were of daily occurrence, and even a
superficial<br>
observer could not fail to detect that under this apparent
devotion to<br>
amusement and enjoyment, our commander-in-chief concealed a deep
stroke of<br>
his policy.</p>

<p>The spirits of both men and officers, broken, in spite of
their successes,<br>
by the incessant privations they had endured, imperatively
demanded this<br>
period of rest and repose. The infantry, many of whom had served
in the<br>
ill-fated campaign of Walcharen, wore still suffering from the
effects of<br>
the intermittent fever. The cavalry, from deficient forage,
severe marches,<br>
and unremitting service, were in great part unfit for duty. To
take the<br>
field under circumstances like these was therefore impossible;
and with the<br>
double object of restoring their wonted spirit to his troops, and
checking<br>
the ravages which sickness and the casualties of war had made
within his<br>
ranks, Lord Wellington embraced the opportunity of the enemy's
inaction to<br>
take up his present position on the Tagus.</p>

<p>But while we were enjoying all the pleasures of a country
life, enhanced<br>
tenfold by daily association with gay and cheerful companions,
the<br>
master-mind, whose reach extended from the profoundest
calculations of<br>
strategy to minutest details of military organization, was never
idle.<br>
Foreseeing that a period of inaction, like the present, must only
be like<br>
the solemn calm that preludes the storm, he prepared for the
future by<br>
those bold conceptions and unrivalled combinations which were to
guide him<br>
through many a field of battle and of danger to end his career of
glory in<br>
the liberation of the Peninsula.</p>

<p>The failure of the attack upon Badajos had neither damped his
ardor nor<br>
changed his views; and he proceeded to the investment of Ciudad
Rodrigo<br>
with the same intense determination of uprooting the French
occupation in<br>
Spain by destroying their strongholds and cutting off their
resources.<br>
Carrying aggressive war in one hand, he turned the other towards
the<br>
maintenance of those defences which, in the event of disaster or
defeat,<br>
must prove the refuge of the army.</p>

<p>To the lines of Torres Vedras he once more directed his
attention. Engineer<br>
officers were despatched thither; the fortresses were put into
repair; the<br>
bridges broken or injured during the French invasion were
restored; the<br>
batteries upon the Tagus were rendered more effective, and
furnaces for<br>
heating shot were added to them.</p>

<p>The inactivity and apathy of the Portuguese government but ill
corresponded<br>
with his unwearied exertions; and despite of continual
remonstrances and<br>
unceasing representations, the bridges over the Leira and Alva
were left<br>
unrepaired, and the roads leading to them, so broken as to be
almost<br>
impassable, might seriously have endangered the retreat of the
army, should<br>
such a movement be deemed necessary.</p>

<p>It was in the first week of September. I was sent with
despatches for the<br>
engineer officer in command at the lines, and during the
fortnight of my<br>
absence, was enabled for the first time to examine those
extraordinary<br>
defences which, for the space of thirty miles, extended over a
country<br>
undulating in hill and valley, and presenting, by a succession of
natural<br>
and artificial resources, the strongest and most impregnable
barrier that<br>
has ever been presented against the advance of a conquering
army.</p>

<br><br><br><br><p>CHAPTER XXXI.</p>

<p>MICKEY FREE'S ADVENTURE.</p>

<p>When I returned to the camp, I found the greatest excitement
prevailing on<br>
all sides. Each day brought in fresh rumors that Marmont was
advancing<br>
in force; that sixty thousand Frenchmen were in full march upon
Ciudad<br>
Rodrigo, to raise the blockade, and renew the invasion of
Portugal.<br>
Intercepted letters corroborated these reports; and the Guerillas
who<br>
joined us spoke of large convoys which they had seen upon the
roads from<br>
Salamanca and Tamanes.</p>

<p>Except the light division, which, under the command of
Crawfurd, were<br>
posted upon the right of the Aguada, the whole of our army
occupied the<br>
country from El Bodon to Gallegos; the Fourth Division being
stationed at<br>
Fuente Guenaldo, where some intrenchments had been hastily thrown
up.</p>

<p>To this position Lord Wellington resolved upon retreating, as
affording<br>
points of greater strength and more capability of defence than
the other<br>
line of road, which led by Almeida upon the Coa. Of the enemy's
intentions<br>
we were not long to remain in doubt; for on the morning of the
24th, a<br>
strong body were seen descending from the pass above Ciudad
Rodrigo, and<br>
cautiously reconnoitring the banks of the Aguada. Far in the
distance a<br>
countless train of wagons, bullock-cars, and loaded mules were
seen winding<br>
their slow length along, accompanied by several squadrons of
dragoons.</p>

<p>Their progress was slow, but as evening fell they entered the
gates of<br>
the fortress; and the cheering of the garrison mixing with the
strains<br>
of martial music, faint from distance, reached us where we lay
upon the<br>
far-off heights of El Bodon. So long as the light lasted, we
could perceive<br>
fresh troops arriving; and even when the darkness came on, we
could detect<br>
the position of the reinforcing columns by the bright watch-fires
which<br>
gleamed along the plain.</p>

<p>By daybreak we were under arms, anxiously watching for the
intentions of<br>
our enemy, which soon became no longer dubious. Twenty-five
squadrons of<br>
cavalry, supported by a whole division of infantry, were seen to
defile<br>
along the great road from Ciudad Rodrigo to Guenaldo. Another
column,<br>
equally numerous, marched straight upon Espeja; nothing could be
more<br>
beautiful, nothing more martial, than their appearance: emerging
from a<br>
close mountain gorge, they wound along the narrow road and
appeared upon<br>
the bridge of the Aguada just as the morning sun was bursting
forth,<br>
its bright beams tipping the polished cuirassiers and their
glittering<br>
equipments, they shone in their panoply like the gay troop of
some ancient<br>
tournament. The lancers of Berg, distinguished by their scarlet
dolmans<br>
and gorgeous trappings, were followed by the Cuirassiers of the
Guard,<br>
who again were succeeded by the <i>chasseurs &agrave; cheval</i>,
their bright steel<br>
helmets and light-blue uniforms, their floating plumes and
dappled<br>
chargers, looking the very <i>beau id&eacute;al</i> of light horsemen;
behind, the dark<br>
masses of the infantry pressed forward and deployed into the
plain; while,<br>
bringing up the rear, the rolling din, like distant thunder,
announced the<br>
"dread artillery."</p>

<p>On they came, the seemingly interminable line converging on to
that one<br>
spot upon whose summit now we assembled a force of scarcely ten
thousand<br>
bayonets.</p>

<p>While this brilliant panorama was passing before our eyes, we
ourselves<br>
were not idle. Orders had been sent to Picton to come up from the
left with<br>
his division. Alten's cavalry and a brigade of artillery were
sent to the<br>
front, and every preparation which the nature of the ground
admitted was<br>
made to resist the advance of the enemy. While these movements on
either<br>
side occupied some hours, the scene was every moment increasing
in<br>
interest. The large body of cavalry was now seen forming into
columns of<br>
attack. Nine battalions of infantry moved up to their support,
and forming<br>
into columns, echelons, and squares, performed before us all the
manoeuvres<br>
of a review with the most admirable precision and rapidity; but
from these<br>
our attention was soon taken by a brilliant display upon our
left. Here,<br>
emerging from the wood which flanked the Aguada, were now to be
seen the<br>
gorgeous staff of Marmont himself. Advancing at a walk, they came
forward<br>
amidst the <i>vivas</i> of the assembled thousands, burning with ardor
and<br>
thirsting for victory. For a moment, as I looked, I could detect
the<br>
marshal himself, as, holding his plumed hat above his head, he
returned the<br>
salute of a lancer regiment, who proudly waved their banners as
he passed;<br>
but, hark, what are those clanging sounds which, rising high
above the<br>
rest, seem like the war-cry of a warrior?</p>

<p>"I can't mistake those tones," said a bronzed old veteran
beside me; "those<br>
are the brass bands of the Imperial Guard. Can Napoleon be there?
See,<br>
there they come!" As he spoke, the head of a column emerged from
the wood,<br>
and deploying as they came, poured into the plain. For above an
hour that<br>
mighty tide flowed on, and before noon a force of sixty thousand
men was<br>
collected in the space beneath us.</p>

<p>I was not long to remain an unoccupied spectator of this
brilliant display,<br>
for I soon received orders to move down with my squadron to the
support of<br>
the Eleventh Light Dragoons, who were posted at the base of the
hill. The<br>
order at the moment was anything but agreeable, for I was mounted
upon a<br>
hack pony, on which I had ridden over from Crawfurd's Division
early in the<br>
morning, and suspecting that there might be some hot work during
the day,<br>
had ordered Mike to follow with my horse. There was no time,
however, for<br>
hesitation, and I moved my men down the slope in the direction of
the<br>
skirmishers.</p>

<p>The position we occupied was singularly favorable,&mdash;our flanks
defended on<br>
either side by brushwood, we could only be assailed in front; and
here,<br>
notwithstanding our vast inferiority of force, we steadily
awaited the<br>
attack. As I rode from out the thick wood, I could not help
feeling<br>
surprised at the sounds which greeted me. Instead of the usual
low and<br>
murmuring tones, the muttered sentences which precede a cavalry
advance,&mdash;a<br>
roar of laughter shook the entire division, while exclamations
burst from<br>
every side around me: "Look at him now!" "They have him, by
heavens, they<br>
have him!" "Well done, well done!" "How the fellow rides!" "He's
hit, he's<br>
hit!" "No, no!" "Is he down?" "He's down!"</p>

<p>A loud cheer rent the air at this moment, and I reached the
front in time<br>
to learn, the reason of all this excitement. In the wide plain
before me a<br>
horseman was seen, having passed the ford of the Aguada, to
advance at<br>
the top of his speed towards the British lines. As he came
nearer, it was<br>
perceived that he was accompanied by a led horse, and apparently
with total<br>
disregard of the presence of an enemy, rode boldly and carelessly
forward.<br>
Behind him rode three lancers, their lances couched, their horses
at speed;<br>
the pace was tremendous, and the excitement intense: for
sometimes, as the<br>
leading horseman of the pursuit neared the fugitive, he would
bend suddenly<br>
upon the saddle, and swerving to the right or the left, totally
evade him,<br>
while again at others, with a loud cry of bold defiance, rising
in his<br>
stirrups, he would press on, and with a shake of his bridle that
bespoke<br>
the jockey, almost distance the enemy.</p>

<p>"That must be your fellow, O'Malley; that must be your Irish
groom!" cried<br>
a brother officer. There could be no doubt of it. It was Mike
himself.</p>

<p>"I'll be hanged, if he's not playing with them!" said Baker.
"Look at the<br>
villain! He's holding in; that's more than the Frenchmen are
doing. Look!<br>
look at the fellow on the gray horse! He has flung his trumpet to
his back,<br>
and drawn his sabre."</p>

<p>A loud cheer burst from the French lines; the trumpeter was
gaining at<br>
every stride. Mike had got into deep ground, and the horses would
not keep<br>
together. "Let the brown horse go! Let him go, man!" shouted the
dragoons,<br>
while I re-echoed the cry with my utmost might. But not so, Mike
held<br>
firmly on, and spurring madly, he lifted his horse at each
stride, turning<br>
from time to time a glance at his pursuer. A shout of triumph
rose from the<br>
French side; tin; trumpeter was beside him; his arm was uplifted;
the sabre<br>
above his head. A yell broke from the British, and with
difficulty could<br>
the squadron be restrained. For above a minute the horses went
side by<br>
side, but the Frenchman delayed his stroke until he could get a
little in<br>
the front. My excitement had rendered me speechless; if a word
could have<br>
saved my poor fellow, I could not have spoken. A mist seemed to
gather<br>
across my eyes, and the whole plain and its peopled thousands
danced before<br>
my vision.</p>

<p>"He's down!" "He's down, by heavens!" "No! no, no!" "Look
there! Nobly<br>
done!" "Gallant fellow!" "He has him! he has him, by &mdash;&mdash;!" A
cheer that<br>
rent the very air above us broke from the squadrons, and Mike
galloped in<br>
among us, holding the Frenchman by the throat with one hand; the
bridle of<br>
his horse he firmly grasped with his own in the other.</p>

<a name="0255"></a>
<img alt="0255.jpg (154K)" src="0255.jpg" height="627" width="820">

<p>[MIKE CAPTURING THE TRUMPETER.]</p>
<br><br>

<p>"How was it? How did he do it?"</p>

<p>"He broke his sword-arm with a blow, and the Frenchman's sabre
fell to the<br>
earth."</p>

<p>"Here he is, Mister Charles; and musha, but it's trouble he
gave me to<br>
catch him! And I hope your honor won't be displeased at me losing
the brown<br>
horse. I was obliged to let him go when the thief closed on me;
but sure,<br>
there he is! May I never, if he's not galloping into the lines by
himself!"<br>
As he spoke, my brown charger came cantering up to the squadrons,
and took<br>
his place in the line with the rest.</p>

<p>I had scarcely time to mount my horse, amidst a buzz of
congratulations,<br>
when our squadron was ordered to the front. Mixed up with
detachments from<br>
the Eleventh and Sixteenth, we continued to resist the enemy for
about two<br>
hours.</p>

<p>Our charges were quick, sharp, and successive, pouring in our
numbers<br>
wherever the enemy appeared for a moment to be broken, and then
retreating<br>
under cover of our infantry when the opposing cavalry came down
upon us in<br>
overwhelming numbers.</p>

<p>Nothing could be more perfect than the manner in which the
different troops<br>
relieved each other during this part of the day. When the French
squadrons<br>
advanced, ours met them as boldly. When the ground became no
longer<br>
tenable, we broke and fell back, and the bayonets of the infantry
arrested<br>
their progress. If the cavalry pressed heavily upon the squares,
ours came<br>
up to the relief, and as they were beaten back, the artillery
opened upon<br>
them with an avalanche of grape-shot.</p>

<p>I have seen many battles of greater duration and more
important in result;<br>
many there have been in which more tactic was displayed, and
greater<br>
combinations called forth,&mdash;but never did I witness a more
desperate<br>
hand-to-hand conflict than on the heights of El Bodon.</p>

<p>Baffled by our resistance, Montbrun advanced with the
Cuirassiers of the<br>
Guard. Riding down our advanced squadrons, they poured upon us
like some<br>
mighty river, overwhelming all before it, and charged, cheering,
up the<br>
heights. Our brave troopers were thrown back upon the artillery,
and many<br>
of them cut down beside the guns. The artillerymen and the
drivers shared<br>
the same fate, and the cannon were captured. A cheer of
exultation burst<br>
from the French, and their <i>vivas</i> rent the air. Their exultation
was<br>
short-lived, and that cheer their death-cry; for the Fifth Foot,
who had<br>
hitherto lain concealed in the grass, sprang madly to their feet,
their<br>
gallant Major Ridge at their head. With a yell of vengeance they
rushed<br>
upon the foe; the glistening bayonets glanced amidst the cavalry
of the<br>
French; the troops pressed hotly home; and while the cuirassiers
were<br>
driven down the hill, the guns were recaptured, limbered up, and
brought<br>
away. This brilliant charge was the first recorded instance of
cavalry<br>
being assailed by infantry in line.</p>

<p>But the hill could no longer be held; the French were
advancing on either<br>
flank; overwhelming numbers pressed upon the front, and retreat
was<br>
unavoidable. The cavalry were ordered to the rear, and Picton's
Division,<br>
throwing themselves into squares, covered the retreating
movement.</p>

<p>The French dragoons bore down upon every face of those devoted
battalions;<br>
the shouts of triumph cheered them as the earth trembled beneath
their<br>
charge,&mdash;but the British infantry, reserving their fire until the
sabres<br>
clanked with the bayonet, poured in a shattering volley, and the
cry of the<br>
wounded and the groans of the dying rose from the smoke around
them.</p>

<p>Again and again the French came on; and the same fate ever
awaited then.<br>
The only movement in the British squares was closing up the
spaces as their<br>
comrades fell or sank wounded to the earth.</p>

<p>At last reinforcements came up from the left; the whole
retreated across<br>
the plain, until as they approached Guenaldo, our cavalry,
having<br>
re-formed, came to their aid with one crushing charge, which
closed the<br>
day.</p>

<p>That same night Lord Wellington fell back, and concentrating
his troops<br>
within a narrow loop of land bounded on either flank by the Coa,
awaited<br>
the arrival of the light division, which joined us at three in
the morning.</p>

<p>The following day Marmont again made a demonstration of his
force, but no<br>
attack followed. The position was too formidable to be easily
assailed, and<br>
the experience of the preceding day had taught him that, however
inferior<br>
in numbers, the troops he was opposed to were as valiant as they
were ably<br>
commanded.</p>

<p>Soon after this, Marmont retired on the valley of the Tagus.
Dorsenne also<br>
fell back, and for the present at least, no further effort was
made to<br>
prosecute the invasion of Portugal.</p>

<br><br><br><br><p>CHAPTER XXXII.</p>

<p>THE SAN PETRO.</p>

<p>"Not badly wounded, O'Malley, I hope?" said General Crawfurd,
as I waited<br>
upon him soon after the action.</p>

<p>I could not help starting at the question, while he repeated
it, pointing<br>
at the same time to my left shoulder, from which a stream of
blood was now<br>
flowing down my coat-sleeve.</p>

<p>"I never noticed it, sir, till this moment. It can't be of
much<br>
consequence, for I have been on horseback the entire day, and
never felt<br>
it."</p>

<p>"Look to it at once, boy; a man wants all his blood for this
campaign. Go<br>
to your quarters. I shall not need you for the present; so pray
see the<br>
doctor at once."</p>

<p>As I left the general's quarters, I began to feel sensible of
pain, and<br>
before a quarter of an hour had elapsed, had quite convinced
myself that my<br>
wound was a severe one. The hand and arm were swollen, heavy, and
distended<br>
with hemorrhage beneath the skin, my thirst became great, and a
cold,<br>
shuddering sensation passed over me from time to time.</p>

<p>I sat down for a moment upon the grass, and was just
reflecting within<br>
myself what course I should pursue, when I heard the tramp of
feet<br>
approaching. I looked up, and perceived some soldiers in fatigue
dresses,<br>
followed by a few others who, from their noiseless gestures and
sad<br>
countenances, I guessed were carrying some wounded comrade to the
rear.</p>

<p>"Who is it, boys?" cried I.</p>

<p>"It's the major, sir, the Lord be good to him!" said a
hardy-looking<br>
Eighty-eighth man, wiping his eye with the cuff of his coat as he
spoke.</p>

<p>"Not your major? Not Major O'Shaughnessy?" said I, jumping up
and rushing<br>
forward towards the litter. Alas, too true, it was the gallant
fellow<br>
himself! There he lay, pale and cold; his bloodless cheek and
parted lips<br>
looking like death itself. A thin blue rivulet trickled from his
forehead,<br>
but his most serious wound appeared to be in the side; his coat
was open,<br>
and showed a mass of congealed and clotted blood, from the midst
of which,<br>
with every motion of the way, a fresh stream kept welling upward.
Whether<br>
from the shock or my loss of blood or from both together, I know
not, but I<br>
sank fainting to the ground.</p>

<p>It would have needed a clearer brain and a cooler judgment
than I possessed<br>
to have conjectured where I was, and what had occurred to me,
when next<br>
I recovered my senses. Weak, fevered, and with a burning thirst,
I lay,<br>
unable to move, and could merely perceive the objects which lay
within the<br>
immediate reach of my vision. The place was cold, calm, and still
as the<br>
grave. A lamp, which hung high above my head, threw a faint light
around,<br>
and showed me, within a niche of the opposite wall, the figure of
a<br>
gorgeously dressed female; she appeared to be standing
motionless, but as<br>
the pale light flickered upon her features, I thought I could
detect the<br>
semblance of a smile. The splendor of her costume and the
glittering gems<br>
which shone upon her spotless robe gleamed through the darkness
with an<br>
almost supernatural brilliancy, and so beautiful did she look, so
calm her<br>
pale features, that as I opened and shut my eyes and rubbed my
lids, I<br>
scarcely dared to trust to my erring senses, and believe it could
be<br>
real. What could it mean? Whence this silence; this cold sense of
awe<br>
and reverence? Was it a dream; was it the fitful vision of a
disordered<br>
intellect? Could it be death? My eyes were riveted upon that
beautiful<br>
figure. I essayed to speak, but could not; I would have beckoned
her<br>
towards me, but my hands refused their office. I felt I know not
what charm<br>
she possessed to calm my throbbing brain and burning heart; but
as I turned<br>
from the gloom and darkness around to gaze upon her fair brow and
unmoved<br>
features, I felt like the prisoner who turns from the cheerless
desolation<br>
of his cell, and looks upon the fair world and the smiling
valleys lying<br>
sunlit and shadowed before him.</p>

<p>Sleep at length came over me; and when I awoke, the day seemed
breaking,<br>
for a faint gray tint stole through a stained-glass window, and
fell in<br>
many colored patches upon the pavement. A low muttering sound
attracted me;<br>
I listened, it was Mike's voice. With difficulty raising myself
upon one<br>
arm, I endeavored to see more around me. Scarcely had I assumed
this<br>
position, when my eyes once more fell upon the white-clad figure
of the<br>
preceding night. At her feet knelt Mike, his hands clasped, and
his head<br>
bowed upon his bosom. Shall I confess my surprise, my
disappointment! It<br>
was no other than an image of the blessed Virgin, decked out in
all the<br>
gorgeous splendor which Catholic piety bestows upon her saints.
The<br>
features, which the imperfect light and my more imperfect
faculties had<br>
endowed with an expression of calm, angelic beauty, were, to my
waking<br>
senses, but the cold and barren mockery of loveliness; the eyes,
which my<br>
excited brain gifted with looks of tenderness and pity, stared
with no<br>
speculation in them; yet contrasting my feelings of the night
before, full<br>
as they were of, their deceptions, with my now waking thoughts, I
longed<br>
once more for that delusion which threw a dreamy pleasure over
me, and<br>
subdued the stormy passions of my soul into rest and repose.</p>

<p>"Who knows," thought I, "but he who kneels yonder feels now as
I did then?<br>
Who can tell how little the cold, unmeaning reality before him
resembles<br>
the spiritualized creation the fervor of his love and the ardor
of his<br>
devotion may have placed upon that altar? Who can limit or bound
the depth<br>
of that adoration for an object whose attributes appeal not only
to every<br>
sentiment of the heart, but also to every sense of the brain? I
fancy<br>
that I can picture to myself how these tinselled relics, these
tasteless<br>
waxworks, changed by the magic of devotion and of dread, become
to the<br>
humble worshipper images of loveliness and beauty. The dim
religious light;<br>
the reverberating footsteps echoed along those solemn aisles; the
vaulted<br>
arches, into whose misty heights the sacred incense floats
upward, while<br>
the deep organ is pealing its notes of praise or prayer,&mdash;these
are no<br>
slight accessories to all the pomp and grandeur of a church whose
forms and<br>
ceremonial, unchanged for ages and hallowed by a thousand
associations,<br>
appeal to the mind of the humblest peasant or the proudest noble
by all the<br>
weaknesses as by all the more favored features of our
nature."</p>

<p>How long I might have continued to meditate in this strain I
know not, when<br>
a muttered observation from Mike turned the whole current of my
thoughts.<br>
His devotion over, he had seated himself upon the steps of the
altar, and<br>
appeared to be resolving some doubts within himself concerning
his late<br>
pious duties.</p>

<p>"Masses is dearer here than in Galway. Father Rush would be
well pleased<br>
at two-and-sixpence for what I paid three doubloons for, this
morning.<br>
And sure it's droll enough. How expensive an amusement it is to
kill the<br>
French! Here's half a dollar I gave for the soul of a cuirassier
that I<br>
kilt yesterday, and nearly twice as much for an artilleryman I
cut down at<br>
the guns; and because the villain swore like a heythen, Father
Pedro told<br>
me he'd cost more nor if he died like a decent man."</p>

<p>At these words he turned suddenly round towards the Virgin,
and crossing<br>
himself devoutly, added,&mdash;</p>

<p>And sure it's yourself knows if it's fair to make me pay for
devils that<br>
don't know their duties; and after all, if you don't understand
English nor<br>
Irish, I've been wasting my time here this two hours."</p>

<p>"I say, Mike, how's my friend the major! How's Major
O'Shaughnessy?"</p>

<p>"Charmingly, sir. It was only loss of blood that ailed him. A
thief with<br>
a pike&mdash;one of the chaps they call Poles, bekase of the long
sticks they<br>
carry with them&mdash;stuck the major in the ribs; but Doctor
Quill&mdash;God reward<br>
him! he's a great doctor and a funny divil too&mdash;he cured him in
no time."</p>

<p>"And where is he now, Mike?"</p>

<p>"Just convanient, in a small chapel off the sacristy; and
throuble enough<br>
we have to keep him quiet. He gave up the <i>con</i>fusion of roses,
and took<br>
to punch; and faith, it isn't hymns nor paslams [psalms] he's
singing all<br>
night. And they had me there, mixing materials and singing songs,
till I<br>
heard the bell for matins; and what between the punch and the
prayers, I<br>
never closed my eyes."</p>

<p>"What do they call this convent?"</p>

<p>"It is a hard word, I misremember. It's something like
saltpetre. But how's<br>
your honor? It's time to ask."</p>

<p>"Much better, Mike, much better. But as I see that either your
drink or<br>
your devotion seems to have affected your nerves, you'd better
lie down for<br>
an hour or two. I shall not want you."</p>

<p>"That's just what I can't; for you see I'm making a song for
this evening.<br>
The Rangers has a little supper, and I'm to be there; and though
I've made<br>
one, I'm not sure it'll do. May be your honor would give me your
opinion<br>
about it?"</p>

<p>"With all my heart, Mike; let's hear it."</p>

<p>"Arrah, is it here, before the Virgin and the two blessed
saints that's<br>
up there in the glass cases? But sure, when they make an hospital
of the<br>
place, and after the major's songs last night&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Exactly so, Mike; out with it."</p>

<p>"Well, Ma'am," said he, turning towards the Virgin, "as I
suspect you don't<br>
know English, may be you'll think it's my offices I'm singing.
So, saving<br>
your favor, here it is."</p>

<p>    MR. FREE'S SONG.</p>

<p>    AIR,&mdash;"<i>Arrah, Catty, now can't you be asy?</i>"</p>

<p>    Oh, what stories I'll tell when my sodgering's o'er,<br>
    And the gallant Fourteenth is disbanded;<br>
    Not a drill nor parade will I hear of no more,<br>
    When safely in Ireland landed.<br>
    With the blood that I spilt, the Frenchmen I kilt,<br>
    I'll drive the young girls half crazy;<br>
    And some cute one will cry, with a wink of her eye,<br>
    "Mister Free, now <i>why can't you be asy?</i>"</p>

<p>    I'll tell how we routed the squadrons in fight,<br>
    And destroyed them all at "Talavera,"<br>
    And then I'll just add how we finished the night,<br>
    In learning to dance the "bolera;"<br>
    How by the moonshine we drank raal wine,<br>
    And rose next day fresh as a daisy;<br>
    Then some one will cry, with a look mighty sly,<br>
    "Arrah, Mickey, <i>now can't you lie asy?</i>"</p>

<p>    I'll tell how the nights with Sir Arthur we spent,<br>
    Around a big fire in the air too,<br>
    Or may be enjoying ourselves in a tent,<br>
    Exactly like Donnybrook fair too.<br>
    How he'd call out to me: "Pass the wine, Mr. Free,<br>
    For you're a man never is lazy!"<br>
    Then some one will cry, with a wink of her eye,<br>
    "Arrah, Mickey, dear, <i>can't you be asy?</i>"</p>

<p>    I'll tell, too, the long years in fighting we passed,<br>
    Till Mounseer asked Bony to lead him;<br>
    And Sir Arthur, grown tired of glory at last,<br>
    Begged of one Mickey Free to succeed him.<br>
    "But, acushla," says I, "the truth is I'm shy!<br>
    There's a lady in Ballymacrazy!<br>
    And I swore on the book&mdash;" He gave me a look,<br>
    And cried: "Mickey, <i>now can't you be asy?</i>"</p>

<p>"Arrah, Mickey, now can't you be <i>asy?</i>" sang out a voice in
chorus, and<br>
the next moment Dr. Quill himself made his appearance.</p>

<p>"Well, O'Malley, is it a penitential psalm you're singing, or
is my friend<br>
Mike endeavoring to raise your spirits with a Galway sonata?"</p>

<p>"A little bit of his own muse, Doctor, nothing more; but tell
me, how goes<br>
it with the major,&mdash;is the poor fellow out of danger?"</p>

<p>"Except from the excess of his appetite, I know of no risk he
runs. His<br>
servant is making gruel for him all day in a thing like the
grog-tub of a<br>
frigate. But you've heard the news,&mdash;Sparks has been exchanged.
He came<br>
here last night; but the moment he caught sight of me, he took
his<br>
departure. Begad, I'm sure he'd rather pass a month in Verdun
than a week<br>
in my company!"</p>

<p>"By-the-bye, Doctor, you never told me how this same antipathy
of Sparks<br>
for you had its origin."</p>

<p>"Sure I drove him out of the Tenth before he was three weeks
with the<br>
regiment."</p>

<p>"Ay, I remember; you began the story for me one night on the
retreat from<br>
the Coa, but something broke it off in the middle."</p>

<p>"Just so, I was sent for to the rear to take off some
gentleman's legs that<br>
weren't in dancing condition; but as there's no fear of
interruption now,<br>
I'll finish the story. But first, let us have a peep at the
wounded. What<br>
beautiful anatomists they are in the French artillery! Do you
feel the<br>
thing I have now in my forceps? There,&mdash;don't jump,&mdash;that's a bit
of the<br>
brachial nerve most beautifully displayed. Faith, I think I'll
give Mike a<br>
demonstration."</p>

<p>"Oh, Mister Quill, dear! Oh, Doctor, darling!"</p>

<p>"Arrah, Mickey, now can't ye be asy?" sang out Maurice, with a
perfect<br>
imitation of Mike's voice and manner.</p>

<p>"A little lint here! Bend your arm,&mdash;that's it&mdash;Don't move
your fingers.<br>
Now, Mickey, make me a cup of coffee with a glass of brandy in
it. And now,<br>
Charley, for Sparks. I believe I told you what kind of fellows
the Tenth<br>
were,&mdash;regular out-and-outers. We hadn't three men in the
regiment that<br>
were not from the south of Ireland,&mdash;the <i>bocca Corkana</i> on their
lips, fun<br>
and devilment in their eyes, and more drollery and humbug in
their hearts<br>
than in all the messes in the service put together. No man had
any chance<br>
among them if he wasn't a real droll one; every man wrote his own
songs and<br>
sang them too. It was no small promotion could tempt a fellow to
exchange<br>
out of the corps. You may think, then, what a prize your friend
Sparks<br>
proved to us; we held a court-martial upon him the week after he
joined. It<br>
was proved in evidence that he had never said a good thing in his
life,<br>
and had about as much notion of a joke as a Cherokee has of the
Court of<br>
Chancery; and as to singing, Lord bless you, he had a tune with
wooden<br>
turns to it,&mdash;it was most cruel to hear; and then the look of
him, those<br>
eyes, like dropsical oysters, and the hair standing every way,
like a field<br>
of insane flax, and the mouth with a curl in it like the slit in
the side<br>
of a fiddle. A pleasant fellow that for a mess that always
boasted the<br>
best-looking chaps in the service.</p>

<p>"'What's to be done with him?' said the major; 'shall we tell
him we are<br>
ordered to India, and terrify him about his liver?'</p>

<p>"'Or drill him into a hectic fever?'</p>

<p>"'Or drink him dry?'</p>

<p>"'Or get him into a fight and wing him?'</p>

<p>"'Oh, no,' said I, 'leave him to me; we'll laugh him out of
the corps.'</p>

<p>"'Yes, we'll leave him to you, Maurice,' said the rest.</p>

<p>"And that day week you might read in the 'Gazette,' 'Pierce
Flynn<br>
O'Haygerty, to be Ensign, 10th Foot, <i>vice</i> Sparks,
exchanged.'"</p>

<p>"But how was it done, Maurice; you haven't told me that."</p>

<p>"Nothing easier. I affected great intimacy with Sparks,
bemoaned our hard<br>
fate, mutually, in being attached to such a regiment: 'A damnable
corps<br>
this,&mdash;low, vulgar fellows, practical jokes; not the kind of
thing one<br>
expects in the army. But as for me, I've joined it partly from
necessity.<br>
You, however, who might be in a crack regiment, I can't conceive
your<br>
remaining in it.'</p>

<p>"'But why did you join, Doctor?' said he; 'what necessity
could have<br>
induced you?'</p>

<p>"'Ah, my friend,' said I, '<i>that</i> is the secret,&mdash;<i>that</i> is
the hidden<br>
grief that must lie buried in my own bosom.'</p>

<p>"I saw that his curiosity was excited, and took every means to
increase it<br>
farther. At length, as if yielding to a sudden impulse of
friendship, and<br>
having sworn him to secrecy, I took him aside, and began
thus,&mdash;</p>

<p>"'I may trust you, Sparks, I feel I may; and when I tell you
that my<br>
honor, my reputation, my whole fortune is at stake, you will
judge of the<br>
importance of the trust.'</p>

<p>"The goggle eyes rolled fearfully, and his features exhibited
the most<br>
craving anxiety to hear my story.</p>

<p>"'You wish to know why I left the Fifty-sixth. Now I'll tell
you; but mind,<br>
you're pledged, you're sworn, never to divulge it.'</p>

<p>"'Honor bright.'</p>

<p>"'There, that's enough; I'm satisfied. It was a slight
infraction of the<br>
articles of war; a little breach of the rules and regulations of
the<br>
service; a trifling misconception of the mess code,&mdash;they caught
me one<br>
evening leaving the mess with&mdash;What do you think in my pocket?
But<br>
you'll never tell! No, no, I know you'll not; eight forks and
a<br>
gravy-spoon,&mdash;silver forks every one of them. There now,' said I,
grasping<br>
his hand, 'you have my secret; my fame and character are in your
hands, for<br>
you see they made me quit the regiment,&mdash;a man can't stay in a
corps where<br>
he is laughed at.'</p>

<p>"Covering my face with my handkerchief, as if to conceal my
shame, I turned<br>
away, and left Sparks to his meditations. That same evening we
happened to<br>
have some strangers at mess; the bottle was passing freely round,
and as<br>
usual the good spirits of the party at the top of their bent,
when suddenly<br>
from the lower end of the table, a voice was heard demanding, in
tones of<br>
the most pompous importance, permission to address the president
upon a<br>
topic where the honor of the whole regiment was concerned.</p>

<p>"'I rise, gentlemen,' said Mr. Sparks, 'with feelings the most
painful;<br>
whatever may have been the laxity of habit and freedom of
conversation<br>
habitual in this regiment, I never believed that so flagrant an
instance as<br>
this morning came to my ears&mdash;'</p>

<p>"'Oh, murder!' said I. 'Oh, Sparks, darling, sure you're not
going to<br>
tell?'</p>

<p>"'Doctor Quill,' replied he, in an austere tone, 'it is
impossible for me<br>
to conceal it.'</p>

<p>"'Oh, Sparks, dear, will you betray me?'</p>

<p>"I gave him here a look of the most imploring entreaty, to
which he replied<br>
by one of unflinching sternness.</p>

<p>"'I have made up my mind, sir,' continued he; 'it is possible
the officers<br>
of this corps may look more leniently than I do upon this
transaction; but<br>
know it they shall.'</p>

<p>"'Out with it, Sparks; tell it by all means!' cried a number
of voices; for<br>
it was clear to every one, by this time, that he was involved in
a hoax.</p>

<p>"Amidst, therefore, a confused volley of entreaty on one side,
and my<br>
reiterated prayers for his silence, on the other, Sparks thus
began:&mdash;</p>

<p>"'Are you aware, gentlemen, why Dr. Quill left the
Fifty-sixth?'</p>

<p>"'No, no, no!' rang from all sides; 'let's have it!'</p>

<p>"'No, sir,' said he, turning towards me, 'concealment is
impossible; an<br>
officer detected with the mess-plate in his pocket&mdash;'</p>

<p>"They never let him finish, for a roar of laughter shook the
table from one<br>
end to the other; while Sparks, horror-struck at the lack of
feeling and<br>
propriety that could make men treat such a matter with ridicule,
glared<br>
around him on every side.</p>

<p>"'Oh, Maurice, Maurice!' cried the major, wiping his eyes,
'this is too<br>
bad; this is too bad!'</p>

<p>"'Gracious Heaven!' screamed Sparks, 'can you laugh at
it?'</p>

<p>"'Laugh at it!' re-echoed the paymaster, 'God grant I only
don't burst a<br>
blood-vessel!' And once more the sounds of merriment rang out
anew, and<br>
lasted for several minutes.</p>

<p>"'Oh, Maurice Quill,' cried an old captain, 'you've been too
heavy on the<br>
lad. Why, Sparks, man, he's been humbugging you.'</p>

<p>"Scarcely were the words spoken when he sprang from the room.
The whole<br>
truth flashed at once upon his mind; in an instant he saw that he
had<br>
exposed himself to the merciless ridicule of a mess-table and
that all<br>
peace for him, in that regiment at least, was over.</p>

<p>"We got a glorious fellow in exchange for him; and Sparks
descended into<br>
a cavalry regiment,&mdash;I ask your pardon, Charley,&mdash;where, as you
are well<br>
aware, sharp wit and quick intellect are by no means
indispensable. There<br>
now, don't be angry or you'll do yourself harm. So good-by, for
an hour or<br>
two."</p>

<br><br><br><br><p>CHAPTER XXXIII.</p>

<p>THE COUNT'S LETTER.</p>

<p>O'Shaughnessy's wound, like my own, was happily only
formidable from the<br>
loss of blood. The sabre or the lance are rarely, indeed, so
death-dealing<br>
as the musket or the bayonet; and the murderous fire from a
square of<br>
infantry is far more terrific in its consequences than the
heaviest charge<br>
of a cavalry column. In a few weeks, therefore, we were once more
about and<br>
fit for duty; but for the present the campaign was ended. The
rainy season<br>
with its attendant train of sickness and sorrow set in. The
troops were<br>
cantoned along the line of the frontier,&mdash;the infantry occupying
the<br>
villages, and the cavalry being stationed wherever forage could
be<br>
obtained.</p>

<p>The Fourteenth were posted at Avintas, but I saw little of
them. I was<br>
continually employed upon the staff; and as General Crawfurd's
activity<br>
suffered no diminution from the interruption of the campaign,
rarely passed<br>
a day without eight or nine hours on horseback.</p>

<p>The preparations for the siege of Ciudad Rodrigo occupied our
undivided<br>
attention. To the reduction of this fortress and of Badajos,
Lord<br>
Wellington looked as the most important objects, and prosecuted
his plans<br>
with unremitting zeal. To my staff appointment I owed the
opportunity of<br>
witnessing that stupendous feature of war, a siege; and as many
of my<br>
friends formed part of the blockading force, I spent more than
one night in<br>
the trenches. Indeed, except for this, the tiresome monotony of
life was<br>
most irksome at this period. Day after day the incessant rain
poured down.<br>
The supplies were bad, scanty, and irregular; the hospitals
crowded with<br>
sick; field-sports impracticable; books there were none; and a
dulness and<br>
spiritless depression prevailed on every side. Those who were
actively<br>
engaged around Ciudad Rodrigo had, of course, the excitement and
interest<br>
which the enterprise involved: but even there the works made slow
progress.<br>
The breaching artillery was defective in every way: the rain
undermined the<br>
faces of the bastions; the clayey soil sank beneath the weight of
the heavy<br>
guns; and the storms of one night frequently destroyed more than
a whole<br>
week's labor had effected.</p>

<p>Thus passed the dreary months along; the cheeriest and gayest
among us<br>
broken in spirit, and subdued in heart by the tedium of our life.
The very<br>
news which reached us partook of the gloomy features of our
prospects. We<br>
heard only of strong reinforcements marching to the support of
the French<br>
in Estramadura. We were told that the Emperor, whose successes in
Germany<br>
enabled him to turn his entire attention to the Spanish campaign,
would<br>
himself be present in the coming spring, with overwhelming odds
and a firm<br>
determination to drive us from the Peninsula.</p>

<p>In that frame of mind which such gloomy and depressing
prospects are well<br>
calculated to suggest, I was returning one night to my quarters
at Mucia,<br>
when suddenly I beheld Mike galloping towards me with a large
packet in his<br>
hand, which he held aloft to catch my attention. "Letters from
England,<br>
sir," said he, "just arrived with the general's despatches." I
broke the<br>
envelope at once, which bore the war-office seal, and as I did
so, a<br>
perfect avalanche of letters fell at my feet. The first which
caught my eye<br>
was an official intimation from the Horse Guards that the Prince
Regent had<br>
been graciously pleased to confirm my promotion to the troop, my
commission<br>
to bear date from the appointment, etc., etc. I could not help
feeling<br>
struck, as my eye ran rapidly across the lines, that although the
letter<br>
came from Sir George Dashwood's office, it contained not a word
of<br>
congratulation nor remembrance on his part, but was couched in
the usual<br>
cold and formal language of an official document. Impatient,
however, to<br>
look over my other letters, I thought but little of this; so,
throwing them<br>
hurriedly into my sabretasche, I cantered on to my quarters
without delay.<br>
Once more alone in silence, I sat down to commune with my far-off
friends,<br>
and yet with all my anxiety to hear of home, passed several
minutes in<br>
turning over the letters, guessing from whom they might have
come, and<br>
picturing to myself their probable contents. "Ah, Frank Webber, I
recognize<br>
your slap-dash, bold hand without the aid of the initials in the
corner;<br>
and this&mdash;what can this be?&mdash;this queer, misshapen thing,
representing<br>
nothing save the forty-seventh proposition of Euclid, and the
address<br>
seemingly put on with a cat's-tail dipped in lampblack? Yes, true
enough,<br>
it is from Mister Free himself. And what have we here? This
queer, quaint<br>
hand is no new acquaintance; how many a time have I looked upon
it as the<br>
<i>ne plus ultra</i> of caligraphy! But here is one I'm not so sure
of. Who<br>
could have written this bolt-upright, old-fashioned
superscription, not<br>
a letter of which seems on speaking terms with its neighbor? The
very O<br>
absolutely turns its back upon the M in O'Malley, and the final Y
wags his<br>
tail with a kind of independent shake, as if he did not care a
curse for<br>
his predecessors! And the seal, too,&mdash;surely I know that
griffin's head,<br>
and that stern motto, <i>Non rogo sed capio</i>. To be sure, it is
Billy<br>
Considine's, the count himself. The very paper, yellow and
time-stained,<br>
looks coeval with his youth; and I could even venture to wager
that his<br>
sturdy pen was nibbed half a century since. I'll not look farther
among<br>
this confused mass of three-cornered billets, and long,
treacherous-looking<br>
epistles, the very folding of which denote the dun. Here goes for
the<br>
count!" So saying to myself, I drew closer to the fire, and began
the<br>
following epistle:&mdash;</p>

<p>    O'MALLEY CASTLE, November 3.</p>

<p>    Dear Charley,&mdash;Here we sit in the little parlor with your
last<br>
    letter, the "Times," and a big map before us, drinking your
health,<br>
    and wishing you a long career of the same glorious success
you have<br>
    hitherto enjoyed. Old as I am&mdash;eighty-two or eighty-three (I
forget<br>
    which) in June&mdash;I envy you with all my heart. Luck has
stood<br>
    to you, my boy; and if a French sabre or a bayonet finish you
now,<br>
    you've at least had a splendid burst of it. I was right in my
opinion<br>
    of you, and Godfrey himself owns it now,&mdash;a lawyer, indeed!
Bad<br>
    luck to them! we've had enough of lawyers. There's old
Hennesy,&mdash;honest<br>
    Jack, as they used to call him,&mdash;that your uncle trusted<br>
    for the last forty years, has raised eighteen thousand pounds
on the<br>
    title-deeds, and gone off to America. The old scoundrel! But
it's<br>
    no use talking; the blow is a sore one to Godfrey, and the
gout<br>
    more troublesome than ever. Drumgold is making a motion
in<br>
    Chancery about it, to break the sale, and the tenants are in
open<br>
    rebellion and swear they'll murther a receiver, if one is
sent down<br>
    among them. Indeed, they came in such force into Galway
during<br>
    the assizes, and did so much mischief, that the cases for
trial were<br>
    adjourned, and the judges left with a military escort to
protect them.<br>
    This, of course, is gratifying to our feelings; for, thank
Providence,<br>
    there is some good in the world yet. Kilmurry was sold last
week<br>
    for twelve thousand. Andy Blake would foreclose the
mortgage,<br>
    although we offered him every kind of satisfaction. This has
done<br>
    Godfrey a deal of harm; and some pitiful economy&mdash;taking
only<br>
    two bottles of claret after his dinner&mdash;has driven the gout
to his<br>
    head. They've been telling him he'd lengthen his days by
this, and<br>
    I tried it myself, and, faith, it was the longest day I ever
spent in<br>
    my life. I hope and trust you take your liquor like a
gentleman and<br>
    an Irish gentleman.</p>

<p>    Kinshela, we hear, has issued an execution against the
house and<br>
    furniture; but the attempt to sell the demesne nearly killed
your<br>
    uncle. It was advertised in a London paper, and an offer made
for it<br>
    by an old general whom you may remember when down here.
Indeed,<br>
    if I mistake not, he was rather kind to you in the beginning.
It<br>
    would appear he did not wish to have his name known, but we
found<br>
    him out, and such a letter as we sent him! It's little liking
he'll<br>
    have to buy a Galway gentleman's estate over his head, that
same Sir<br>
    George Dashwood! Godfrey offered to meet him anywhere he<br>
    pleased, and if the doctor thought he could bear the sea
voyage,<br>
    he'd even go over to Holyhead; but the sneaking fellow sent
an<br>
    apologetic kind of a letter, with some humbug excuse about
very<br>
    different motives, etc. But we've done with him, and I think
he<br>
    with us.</p>

<p>When I had read thus far, I laid down the letter, unable to go
on; the<br>
accumulated misfortunes of one I loved best in the world,
following so fast<br>
one upon another, the insult&mdash;unprovoked, gratuitous insult&mdash;to
him upon<br>
whom my hopes of future happiness so much depended, completely
overwhelmed<br>
me. I tried to continue. Alas, the catalogue of evils went on;
each line<br>
bore testimony to some farther wreck of fortune, some clearer
evidence of a<br>
ruined house.</p>

<p>All that my gloomiest and darkest forebodings had pictured was
come to<br>
pass; sickness, poverty, harassing unfeeling creditors,
treachery, and<br>
ingratitude were goading to madness and despair a spirit whose
kindliness<br>
of nature was unequalled. The shock of blasted fortunes was
falling upon<br>
the dying heart; the convictions which a long life had never
brought<br>
home&mdash;that men were false and their words a lie&mdash;were stealing
over the<br>
man upon the brink of the grave; and he who had loved his
neighbor like a<br>
brother was to be taught, at the eleventh hour, that the beings
he trusted<br>
were perjured and forsworn.</p>

<p>A more unsuitable adviser than Considine, in difficulties like
these, there<br>
could not be; his very contempt for all the forms of law and
justice was<br>
sufficient to embroil my poor uncle still farther; so that I
resolved at<br>
once to apply for leave, and if refused, and no other alternative
offered,<br>
to leave the service. It was not without a sense of sorrow
bordering on<br>
despair, that I came to this determination. My soldier's life had
become<br>
a passion with me. I loved it for its bold and chivalrous
enthusiasm, its<br>
hour of battle and strife, its days of endurance and hardship,
its trials,<br>
its triumphs; its very reverses were endeared by those they were
shared<br>
with; and the spirit of adventure and the love of danger&mdash;that
most<br>
exciting of all gambling&mdash;had now entwined themselves in my very
nature. To<br>
surrender all these at once, and to exchange the daily, hourly
enthusiasm<br>
of a campaign for the prospects now before me, was almost
maddening. But<br>
still a sustaining sense of duty of what I owed to him, who, in
his love,<br>
had sacrificed all for me, overpowered every other consideration.
My mind<br>
was made up.</p>

<p>Father Rush's letter was little more than a recapitulation of
the count's.<br>
Debt, distress, sickness, and the heart-burnings of altered
fortunes filled<br>
it; and when I closed it, I felt like one over all whose views in
life a<br>
dark and ill-omened cloud was closing forever. Webber's I could
not read;<br>
the light and cheerful raillery of a friend would have seemed, at
such a<br>
time, like the cold, unfeeling sarcasm of an enemy. I sat down at
last to<br>
write to the general, enclosing my application for leave, and
begging of<br>
him to forward it, with a favorable recommendation, to
headquarters.</p>

<p>This done, I lay down upon my bed, and overcome by fatigue and
fretting,<br>
fell asleep to dream of my home and those I had left there;
which,<br>
strangely too, were presented to my mind with all the happy
features that<br>
made them so dear to my infancy.</p>

<br><br><br><br><p>CHAPTER XXXIV.</p>

<p>THE TRENCHES.</p>

<p>"I have not had time, O'Malley, to think of your application,"
said<br>
Crawfurd, "nor is it likely I can for a day or two. Read that."
So saying,<br>
he pushed towards me a note, written, in pencil, which ran
thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>    CIUDAD RODRIGO, December 18.</p>

<p>    Dear C.,&mdash;Fletcher tells me that the breaches will be
practicable<br>
    by to-morrow evening, and I think so myself. Come over, then,
at<br>
    once, for we shall not lose any time.</p>

<p>    Yours,           W.</p>

<p>"I have some despatches for your regiment, but if you prefer
coming along<br>
with me&mdash;"</p>

<p>"My dear General, dare I ask for such a favor?"</p>

<p>"Well, come along; only remember that, although my division
will be<br>
engaged, I cannot promise you anything to do. So now, get your
horses<br>
ready; let's away."</p>

<p>It was in the afternoon of the following day that we rode into
the large<br>
plain before Ciudad Rodrigo, and in which the allied armies were
now<br>
assembled to the number of twelve thousand men. The loud booming
of<br>
the siege artillery had been heard by me for some hours before;
but<br>
notwithstanding this prelude and my own high-wrought
expectations, I<br>
was far from anticipating the magnificent spectacle which burst
upon my<br>
astonished view. The air was calm and still; a clear, blue,
wintry sky<br>
stretched overhead, but below, the dense blue smoke of the
deafening guns<br>
rolled in mighty volumes along the earth, and entirely concealed
the lower<br>
part of the fortress; above this the tall towers and battlemented
parapets<br>
rose into the thin, transparent sky like fairy palaces. A bright
flash of<br>
flame would now and then burst forth from the walls, and a
clanging crash<br>
of the brass metal be heard; but the unceasing roll of our
artillery nearly<br>
drowned all other sounds, save when a loud cheer would burst from
the<br>
trenches, while the clattering fall of masonry, and the crumbling
stones<br>
as they rolled down, bespoke the reason of the cry. The utmost
activity<br>
prevailed on all sides; troops pressed forward to the reliefs in
the<br>
parallels; ammunition wagons moved to the front; general and
staff officers<br>
rode furiously about the plain; and all betokened that the hour
of attack<br>
was no longer far distant.</p>

<p>While all parties were anxiously awaiting the decision of our
chief, the<br>
general order was made known, which, after briefly detailing the
necessary<br>
arrangements, concluded with the emphatic words, "Ciudad Rodrigo
<i>must</i> be<br>
stormed to-night." All speculation as to the troops to be engaged
in this<br>
daring enterprise was soon at an end; for with his characteristic
sense of<br>
duty, Lord Wellington made no invidious selection, but merely
commanded<br>
that the attack should be made by whatever divisions might chance
to be<br>
that day in the trenches. Upon the Third and Light Divisions,
therefore,<br>
this glorious task devolved. The former was to attack the main
breach;<br>
to Crawfurd's Division was assigned the, if possible, more
difficult<br>
enterprise of carrying the lesser one; while Pack's Portuguese
Brigade were<br>
to menace the convent of La Caridad by a feint attack, to be
converted into<br>
a real one, if circumstances should permit.</p>

<p>The decision, however matured and comprehensive in all its
details, was<br>
finally adopted so suddenly that every staff officer upon the
ground was<br>
actively engaged during the entire evening in conveying the
orders to the<br>
different regiments. As the day drew to a close, the cannonade
slackened on<br>
either side, a solitary gun would be heard at intervals, and in
the calm<br>
stillness around, its booming thunder re-echoed along the valleys
of the<br>
Sierra; but as the moon rose and night set in, these were no
longer heard,<br>
and a perfect stillness and tranquillity prevailed around. Even
in the<br>
trenches, crowded with armed and anxious soldiers, not a whisper
was heard;<br>
and amidst that mighty host which filled the plain, the tramp of
a patrol<br>
could be distinctly noted, and the hoarse voice of the French
sentry upon<br>
the walls, telling that all was well in Ciudad Rodrigo.</p>

<p>The massive fortress, looming larger as its dark shadow stood
out from the<br>
sky, was still as the grave; while in the greater breach a faint
light was<br>
seen to twinkle for a moment, and then suddenly to disappear,
leaving all<br>
gloomy and dark as before.</p>

<p>Having been sent with orders to the Third Division, of which
the<br>
Eighty-eighth formed a part, I took the opportunity of finding
out<br>
O'Shaughnessy, who was himself to lead an escalade party in
M'Kinnon's<br>
Brigade. He sprang towards me as I came forward, and grasping my
hand with<br>
a more than usual earnestness, called out, "The very man I
wanted! Charley,<br>
my boy, do us a service now!"</p>

<p>Before I could reply, he continued in a lower tone, "A young
fellow of<br>
ours, Harry Beauclerc, has been badly wounded in the trenches;
but by some<br>
blunder, his injury is reported as a slight one, and although the
poor<br>
fellow can scarcely stand, he insists upon going with the
stormers."</p>

<p>"Come here, Major, come here!" cried a voice at a little
distance.</p>

<p>"Follow me, O'Malley," cried O'Shaughnessy, moving in the
direction of the<br>
speaker.</p>

<p>By the light of a lantern we could descry two officers
kneeling upon the<br>
ground; between them on the grass lay the figure of a third, upon
whose<br>
features, as the pale light fell, the hand of death seemed
rapidly<br>
stealing. A slight froth, tinged with blood, rested on his lip,
and the<br>
florid blood which stained the buff facing of his uniform
indicated that<br>
his wound was through the lungs.</p>

<p>"He has fainted," said one of the officers, in a low tone.</p>

<p>"Are you certain it is fainting?" said the other, in a still
lower.</p>

<p>"You see how it is, Charley," said O'Shaughnessy; "this poor
boy must be<br>
carried to the rear. Will you then, like a kind fellow, hasten
back to<br>
Colonel Campbell and mention the fact. It will kill Beauclerc
should any<br>
doubt rest upon his conduct, if he ever recover this."</p>

<p>While he spoke, four soldiers of the regiment placed the
wounded officer in<br>
a blanket. A long sigh escaped him, and he muttered a few broken
words.</p>

<p>"Poor fellow, it's his mother he's talking of! He only joined
a month<br>
since, and is a mere boy. Come, O'Malley, lose no time. By Jove!
it is too<br>
late; there goes the first rocket for the columns to form. In ten
minutes<br>
more the stormers must fall in."</p>

<p>"What's the matter, Giles?" said he to one of the officers,
who had stopped<br>
the soldiers as they were moving off with their burden,&mdash;"what is
it?"</p>

<p>"I have been cutting the white tape off his arm; for if he
sees it on<br>
waking, he'll remember all about the storming."</p>

<p>"Quite right&mdash;thoughtfully done!" said the other; "but who is
to lead his<br>
fellows? He was in the forlorn hope."</p>

<p>"I'll do it," cried I, with eagerness. "Come, O'Shaughnessy,
you'll not<br>
refuse me."</p>

<p>"Refuse you, boy!" said he, grasping my hand within both of
his, "never!<br>
But you must change your coat. The gallant Eighty-eighth will
never mistake<br>
their countryman's voice. But your uniform would be devilish
likely to get<br>
you a bayonet through it; so come back with me, and we'll make
you a Ranger<br>
in no time."</p>

<p>"I can give your friend a cap."</p>

<p>"And I," said the other, "a brandy flask, which, after all, is
not the<br>
worst part of a storming equipage."</p>

<p>"I hope," said O'Shaughnessy, "they may find Maurice in the
rear.<br>
Beauclerc's all safe in his hands."</p>

<p>"That they'll not," said Giles, "you may swear. Quill is this
moment in the<br>
trenches, and will not be the last man at the breach."</p>

<p>"Follow me now, lads," said O'Shaughnessy, in a low voice.
"Our fellows are<br>
at the angle of this trench. Who the deuce can that be, talking
so loud?"</p>

<p>"It must be Maurice," said Giles.</p>

<p>The question was soon decided by the doctor himself, who
appeared giving<br>
directions to his hospital-sergeant.</p>

<p>"Yes, Peter, take the tools up to a convenient spot near the
breach.<br>
There's many a snug corner there in the ruins; and although we
mayn't have<br>
as good an operation-room as in old 'Steevens's,' yet we'll beat
them<br>
hollow in cases."</p>

<p>"Listen to the fellow," said Giles, with a shudder. "The
thought of his<br>
confounded thumbscrews and tourniquets is worse to me than a
French<br>
howitzer."</p>

<p>"The devil a kinder-hearted fellow than Maurice," said
O'Shaughnessy, "for<br>
all that; and if his heart was to be known this moment, he'd
rather handle<br>
a sword than a saw."</p>

<p>"True for you, Dennis," said Quill, overhearing him, "but we
are both<br>
useful in our way, as the hangman said to Lord Clare."</p>

<p>"But should you not be in the rear, Maurice?" said I.</p>

<p>"You are right, O'Malley," said he, in a whisper; "but, you
see, I owe the<br>
Cork Insurance Company a spite for making me pay a gout premium,
and that's<br>
the reason I'm here. I warned them at the time that their
stinginess would<br>
come to no good."</p>

<p>"I say, Captain O'Malley," said Giles, "I find I can't be as
good as my<br>
word with you; my servant has moved to the rear with all my
traps."</p>

<p>"What is to be done?" said I.</p>

<p>"Is it shaving utensils you want?" said Maurice. "Would a
scalpel serve<br>
your turn?"</p>

<p>"No, Doctor, I'm going to take a turn of duty with your
fellows to-night."</p>

<p>"In the breach, with the stormers?"</p>

<p>"With the forlorn hope," said O'Shaughnessy. "Beauclerc is so
badly wounded<br>
that we've sent him back; and Charley, like a good fellow, has
taken his<br>
place."</p>

<p>"Martin told me," said Maurice, "that Beauclerc was only
stunned; but,<br>
upon my conscience, the hospital-mates, now-a-days, are no better
than the<br>
watchmakers; they can't tell what's wrong with the instrument
till they<br>
pick it to pieces. Whiz! there goes a blue light."</p>

<p>"Move on, move on," whispered O'Shaughnessy; "they're telling
off the<br>
stormers. That rocket is the order to fall in."</p>

<p>"But what am I to do for a coat?"</p>

<p>"Take mine, my boy," said Maurice, throwing off an upper
garment of coarse<br>
gray frieze as he spoke.</p>

<p>"There's a neat bit of uniform," continued he, turning himself
round for<br>
our admiration; "don't I look mighty like the pictures of George
the First<br>
at the battle of Dettingen!"</p>

<p>A burst of approving laughter was our only answer to this
speech, while<br>
Maurice proceeded to denude himself of his most extraordinary
garment.</p>

<p>"What, in the name of Heaven, is it?" said I.</p>

<p>"Don't despise it, Charley; it knows the smell of gunpowder as
well as any<br>
bit of scarlet in the service;" while he added, in a whisper,
"it's the<br>
ould Roscommon Yeomanry. My uncle commanded them in the year '42,
and this<br>
was his coat. I don't mean to say that it was new then; for you
see it's a<br>
kind of heirloom in the Quill family, and it's not every one I'd
be giving<br>
it to."</p>

<p>"A thousand thanks, Maurice," said I, as I buttoned it on,
amidst an<br>
ill-suppressed titter of laughter.</p>

<p>"It fits you like a sentry-box," said Maurice, as he surveyed
me with a<br>
lantern. "The skirts separate behind in the most picturesque
manner; and<br>
when you button the collar, it will keep your head up so high
that the<br>
devil a bit you'll see except the blessed moon. It's a thousand
pities you<br>
haven't the three-cocked hat with the feather trimming. If you
wouldn't<br>
frighten the French, my name's not Maurice. Turn about here till
I admire<br>
you. If you only saw yourself in a glass, you'd never join the
dragoons<br>
again. And look now, don't be exposing yourself, for I wouldn't
have those<br>
blue facings destroyed for a week's pay."</p>

<p>"Ah, then, it's yourself is the darling, Doctor, dear!" said a
voice behind<br>
me. I turned round; it was Mickey Free, who was standing with a
most<br>
profound admiration of Maurice beaming in every feature of his
face. "It's<br>
yourself has a joke for every hour o' the day."</p>

<p>"Get to the rear, Mike, get to the rear with the cattle; this
is no place<br>
for you or them."</p>

<p>"Good-night, Mickey," said Maurice.</p>

<p>"Good-night, your honor," muttered Mike to himself; "may I
never die till<br>
you set a leg for me."</p>

<p>"Are you dressed for the ball?" said Maurice, fastening the
white tape upon<br>
my arm. "There now, my boy, move on, for I think I hear Picton's
voice; not<br>
that it signifies now, for he's always in a heavenly temper when
any one's<br>
going to be killed. I'm sure he'd behave like an angel, if he
only knew the<br>
ground was mined under his feet."</p>

<p>"Charley, Charley!" called out O'Shaughnessy, in a suppressed
voice, "come<br>
up quickly!"</p>

<p>"No. 24, John Forbes&mdash;here! Edward Gillespie&mdash;here!"</p>

<p>"Who leads this party, Major O'Shaughnessy?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Beauclerc, sir," replied O'Shaughnessy, pushing me
forward by the arm<br>
while he spoke.</p>

<p>"Keep your people together, sir; spare the powder, and trust
to your cold<br>
iron." He grasped my hand within his iron grip, and rode on.</p>

<p>"Who was it, Dennis?" said I.</p>

<p>"Don't you know him, Charley? That was Picton."</p>

<br><br><br><br><p>CHAPTER XXXV.</p>

<p>THE STORMING OF CIUDAD RODRIGO.</p>

<p>Whatever the levity of the previous moment, the scene before
us now<br>
repressed it effectually. The deep-toned bell of the cathedral
tolled<br>
seven, and scarcely were its notes dying away in the distance,
when the<br>
march of the columns was heard stealing along the ground. A low
murmuring<br>
whisper ran along the advanced files of the forlorn hope; stocks
were<br>
loosened; packs and knapsacks thrown to the ground; each man
pressed his<br>
cap more firmly down upon his brow, and with lip compressed and
steadfast<br>
eye, waited for the word to move.</p>

<p>It came at last: the word "March!" passed in whispers from
rank to rank,<br>
and the dark mass moved on. What a moment was that as we advanced
to the<br>
foot of the breach! The consciousness that at the same instant,
from<br>
different points of that vast plain, similar parties were moving
on; the<br>
feeling that at a word the flame of the artillery and the flash
of steel<br>
would spring from that dense cloud, and death and carnage, in
every shape<br>
our imagination can conceive, be dealt on all sides; the hurried,
fitful<br>
thought of home; the years long past compressed into one minute's
space;<br>
the last adieu of all we've loved, mingling with the muttered
prayer to<br>
Heaven, while, high above all, the deep pervading sense that
earth has no<br>
temptation strong enough to turn us from that path whose ending
must be a<br>
sepulchre!</p>

<p>Each heart was too full for words. We followed noiselessly
along the turf,<br>
the dark figure of our leader guiding us through the gloom. On
arriving<br>
at the ditch, the party with the ladders moved to the front.
Already some<br>
hay-packs were thrown in, and the forlorn hope sprang
forward.</p>

<p>All was still and silent as the grave. "Quietly, my men,
quietly!" said<br>
M'Kinnon; "don't press." Scarcely had he spoken when a musket
whose charge,<br>
contrary to orders, had not been drawn, went off. The whizzing
bullet could<br>
not have struck the wall, when suddenly a bright flame burst
forth from the<br>
ramparts, and shot upward towards the sky. For an instant the
whole scene<br>
before us was bright as noonday. On one side, the dark ranks and
glistening<br>
bayonets of the enemy; on the other, the red uniform of the
British<br>
columns: compressed like some solid wall, they stretched along
the plain.</p>

<p>A deafening roll of musketry from the extreme right announced
that the<br>
Third Division was already in action, while the loud cry of our
leader, as<br>
he sprang into the trench, summoned us to the charge. The leading
sections,<br>
not waiting for the ladders, jumped down, others pressing rapidly
behind<br>
them, when a loud rumbling thunder crept along the earth, a
hissing,<br>
crackling noise followed, and from the dark ditch a forked and
livid<br>
lightning burst like the flame from a volcano, and a mine
exploded.<br>
Hundreds of shells and grenades scattered along the ground were
ignited at<br>
the same moment; the air sparkled with the whizzing fuses, the
musketry<br>
plied incessantly from the walls, and every man of the leading
company<br>
of the stormers was blown to pieces. While this dreadful
catastrophe was<br>
enacting before our eyes, the different assaults were made on all
sides;<br>
the whole fortress seemed girt around with fire. From every part
arose the<br>
yells of triumph and the shouts of the assailants. As for us, we
stood upon<br>
the verge of the ditch, breathless, hesitating, and
horror-struck. A sudden<br>
darkness succeeded to the bright glare, but from the midst of the
gloom the<br>
agonizing cries of the wounded and the dying rent our very
hearts.</p>

<p>"Make way there! make way! here comes Mackie's party," cried
an officer<br>
in the front, and as he spoke the forlorn hope of the
Eighty-eighth came<br>
forward at a run; jumping recklessly into the ditch, they made
towards the<br>
breach; the supporting division of the stormers gave one
inspiring cheer,<br>
and sprang after them. The rush was tremendous; for scarcely had
we reached<br>
the crumbling ruins of the rampart, when the vast column,
pressing on like<br>
some mighty torrent, bore down upon our rear. Now commenced a
scene to<br>
which nothing I ever before conceived of war could in any degree
compare:<br>
the whole ground, covered with combustibles of every deadly and
destructive<br>
contrivance, was rent open with a crash; the huge masses of
masonry bounded<br>
into the air like things of no weight; the ringing clangor of the
iron<br>
howitzers, the crackling of the fuses, the blazing splinters, the
shouts of<br>
defiance, the more than savage yell of those in whose ranks alone
the dead<br>
and the dying were numbered, made up a mass of sights and sounds
almost<br>
maddening with their excitement. On we struggled; the mutilated
bodies of<br>
the leading files almost filling the way.</p>

<p>By this time the Third Division had joined us, and the crush
of our<br>
thickening ranks was dreadful; every moment some well-known
leader fell<br>
dead or mortally wounded, and his place was supplied by some
gallant fellow<br>
who, springing from the leading files, would scarcely have
uttered his<br>
cheer of encouragement, ere he himself was laid low. Many a voice
with<br>
whose notes I was familiar, would break upon my ear in tones of
heroic<br>
daring, and the next moment burst forth in a death-cry. For above
an hour<br>
the frightful carnage continued, fresh troops continually
advancing, but<br>
scarcely a foot of ground was made; the earth belched forth its
volcanic<br>
fires, and that terrible barrier did no man pass. In turn the
bravest and<br>
the boldest would leap into the whizzing flame, and the taunting
cheers of<br>
the enemy triumphed in derision at the effort.</p>

<p>"Stormers to the front! Only the bayonet! trust to nothing but
the<br>
bayonet!" cried a voice whose almost cheerful accents contrasted
strangely<br>
with the dead-notes around, and Gurwood, who led the forlorn hope
of<br>
the Fifty-second, bounded into the chasm; all the officers
sprang<br>
simultaneously after him; the men pressed madly on; a roll of
withering<br>
musketry crashed upon them; a furious shout replied to it. The
British,<br>
springing over the dead and dying, bounded like blood-hounds on
their prey.<br>
Meanwhile the ramparts trembled beneath the tramp of the light
division,<br>
who, having forced the lesser breach, came down upon the flank of
the<br>
French. The garrison, however, thickened their numbers, and
bravely held<br>
their ground. Man to man now was the combat. No cry for quarter,
no<br>
supplicating look for mercy; it was the death struggle of
vengeance and<br>
despair. At this instant an explosion louder than the loudest
thunder shook<br>
the air; the rent and torn up ramparts sprang into the sky; the
conquering<br>
and the conquered were alike the victims; for one of the greatest
magazines<br>
had been ignited by a shell; the black smoke, streaked with a
lurid flame,<br>
hung above the dead and the dying. The artillery and the
murderous musketry<br>
were stilled, paralyzed, as it were, by the ruin and devastation
before<br>
them. Both sides stood leaning upon their arms; the pause was
but<br>
momentary; the cries of wounded comrades called upon their
hearts. A fierce<br>
burst of vengeance rent the air; the British closed upon the foe;
for one<br>
instant they were met; the next, the bayonets gleamed upon the
ramparts,<br>
and Ciudad Rodrigo was won.</p>

<br><br><br><br><p>CHAPTER XXXVI.</p>

<p>THE RAMPART.</p>

<p>While such were the scenes passing around me, of my own part
in them, I<br>
absolutely knew nothing; for until the moment that the glancing
bayonets<br>
of the light division came rushing on the foe, and the loud, long
cheer of<br>
victory burst above us, I felt like one in a trance. Then I
leaned against<br>
an angle of the rampart, overpowered and exhausted; a bayonet
wound, which<br>
some soldier of our own ranks had given me when mounting the
breach, pained<br>
me somewhat; my uniform was actually torn to rags; my head bare;
of my<br>
sword, the hilt and four inches of the blade alone remained,
while my left<br>
hand firmly grasped the rammer of a cannon, but why or wherefore
I could<br>
not even guess. As thus I stood, the unceasing tide of soldiery
pressed on;<br>
fresh divisions came pouring in, eager for plunder, and thirsting
for the<br>
spoil. The dead and the dying were alike trampled beneath the
feet of that<br>
remorseless mass, who, actuated by vengeance and by rapine,
sprang fiercely<br>
up the breach.</p>

<p>Weak and exhausted, faint from my wound, and overcome by my
exertions, I<br>
sank among the crumbling ruin. The loud shouts which rose from
the town,<br>
mingled with cries and screams, told the work of pillage was
begun; while<br>
still a dropping musketry could be heard on the distant rampart,
where even<br>
yet the French made resistance. At last even this was hushed, but
to it<br>
succeeded the far more horrifying sounds of rapine and of murder;
the<br>
forked flames of burning houses rose here and there amidst the
black<br>
darkness of the night; and through the crackling of the timbers,
and the<br>
falling crash of roofs, the heart-rending shriek of women rent
the very<br>
air. Officers pressed forward, but in vain were their efforts to
restrain<br>
their men; the savage cruelty of the moment knew no bounds of
restraint.<br>
More than one gallant fellow perished in his fruitless endeavor
to enforce<br>
obedience; and the most awful denunciations were now uttered
against those<br>
before whom, at any other time, they dared not mutter.</p>

<p>Thus passed the long night, far more terrible to me than all
the dangers of<br>
the storm itself, with all its death and destruction dealing
around it. I<br>
know not if I slept: if so, the horrors on every side were
pictured in my<br>
dreams; and when the gray dawn was breaking, the cries from the
doomed city<br>
were still ringing in my ears. Close around me the scene was
still<br>
and silent; the wounded had been removed during the night, but
the<br>
thickly-packed dead lay side by side where they fell. It was a
fearful<br>
sight to see them as, blood-stained and naked (for already
the<br>
camp-followers had stripped the bodies), they covered the entire
breach.<br>
From the rampart to the ditch, the ranks lay where they had stood
in life.<br>
A faint phosphoric flame flickered above their ghastly corpses,
making even<br>
death still more horrible. I was gazing steadfastly, with all
that stupid<br>
intensity which imperfect senses and exhausted faculties possess,
when the<br>
sound of voices near aroused me.</p>

<p>"Bring him along,&mdash;this way, Bob. Over the breach with the
scoundrel, into<br>
the fosse."</p>

<p>"He shall die no soldier's death, by Heaven!" cried another
and a deeper<br>
voice, "if I lay his skull open with my axe."</p>

<p>"Oh, mercy, mercy! as you hope for&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Traitor! don't dare to mutter here!" As the last words were
spoken, four<br>
infantry soldiers, reeling from drunkenness, dragged forward a
pale and<br>
haggard wretch, whose limbs trailed behind him like those of
palsy, his<br>
uniform was that of a French chasseur, but his voice bespoke him
English.</p>

<p>"Kneel down there, and die like a man! You were one once!"</p>

<p>"Not so, Bill, never. Fix bayonets, boys! That's right! Now
take the word<br>
from me."</p>

<p>"Oh, forgive me! for the love of Heaven, forgive me!" screamed
the voice of<br>
the victim; but his last accents ended in a death-cry, for as he
spoke, the<br>
bayonets flashed for an instant in the air, and the next were
plunged into<br>
his body. Twice I had essayed to speak, but my voice, hoarse from
shouting,<br>
came not; and I could but look upon this terrible murder with
staring eyes<br>
and burning brain. At last speech came, as if wrested by the very
excess of<br>
my agony, and I muttered aloud, "O God!" The words were not
well-spoken,<br>
when the muskets were brought to the shoulders, and reeking with
the blood<br>
of the murdered man, their savage faces scowled at me as I
lay.</p>

<p>A short and heart-felt prayer burst from my lips, and I was
still. The<br>
leader of the party called out, "Be steady, and together. One,
two! Ground<br>
arms, boys! Ground arms!" roared he, in a voice of thunder; "it's
the<br>
captain himself!" Down went the muskets with a crash; while,
springing<br>
towards me, the fellows caught me in their arms, and with one
jerk mounted<br>
me upon their shoulders, the cheer that accompanied the sudden
movement<br>
seeming like the yell of maniacs. "Ha, ha, ha! we have him now!"
sang their<br>
wild voices, as, with blood-stained hands and infuriated
features, they<br>
bore me down the rampart. My sensations of disgust and repugnance
to the<br>
party seemed at once to have evidenced themselves, for the
corporal,<br>
turning abruptly round, called out,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Don't <i>pity</i> him, Captain; the scoundrel was a deserter; he
escaped from<br>
the picket two nights ago, and gave information of all our plans
to the<br>
enemy."</p>

<p>"Ay," cried another, "and what's worse, he fired through an
embrasure near<br>
the breach, for two hours, upon his own regiment. It was there we
found<br>
him. This way, lads."</p>

<p>So saying, they turned short from the walls, and dashed down a
dark<br>
and narrow lane into the town. My struggles to get free were
perfectly<br>
ineffectual, and to my entreaties they were totally
indifferent.</p>

<p>In this way, therefore, we made our entrance into the Plaza,
where some<br>
hundred soldiers, of different regiments, were bivouacked. A
shout of<br>
recognition welcomed the fellows as they came; while suddenly a
party of<br>
Eighty-eighth men, springing from the ground, rushed forward with
drawn<br>
bayonets, calling out, "Give him up this minute, or, by the
Father of<br>
Moses, we'll make short work of ye!"</p>

<p>The order was made by men who seemed well disposed to execute
it; and I was<br>
accordingly grounded with a shock and a rapidity that savored
much more<br>
of ready compliance than any respect for my individual comfort. A
roar of<br>
laughter rang through the motley mass, and every powder-stained
face around<br>
me seemed convulsed with merriment. As I sat passively upon the
ground,<br>
looking ruefully about, whether my gestures or my words
heightened the<br>
absurdity of my appearance, it is hard to say; but certainly the
laughter<br>
increased at each moment, and the drunken wretches danced round
me in<br>
ecstasy.</p>

<p>"Where is your major? Major O'Shaughnessy, lads?" said I.</p>

<p>"He's in the church, with the general, your honor," said the
sergeant of<br>
the regiment, upon whom the mention of his officer's name seemed
at once<br>
to have a sobering influence. Assisting me to rise (for I was
weak as a<br>
child), he led me through the dense crowd, who, such is the
influence of<br>
example, now formed into line, and as well as their state
permitted, gave<br>
me a military salute as I passed. "Follow me, sir," said the
sergeant;<br>
"this little dark street to the left will take us to the private
door of<br>
the chapel."</p>

<p>"Wherefore are they there, Sergeant?"</p>

<p>"There's a general of division mortally wounded."</p>

<p>"You did not hear his name?"</p>

<p>"No, sir. All I know is, he was one of the storming party at
the lesser<br>
breach."</p>

<p>A cold, sickening shudder came over me; I durst not ask
farther, but<br>
pressed on with anxious steps towards the chapel.</p>

<p>"There, sir, yonder, where you see the light. That's the
door."</p>

<p>So saying, the sergeant stopped suddenly, and placed his hand
to his cap. I<br>
saw at once that he was sufficiently aware of his condition not
to desire<br>
to appear before his officers; so, hurriedly thanking him, I
walked<br>
forward.</p>

<p>"Halt, there! and give the countersign," cried a sentinel, who
with fixed<br>
bayonet stood before the door.</p>

<p>"I am an officer," said I, endeavoring to pass in.</p>

<p>"Stand bock, stand bock!" said the harsh voice of the
Highlander, for such<br>
he was.</p>

<p>"Is Major O'Shaughnessy in the church?"</p>

<p>"I dinna ken," was the short, rough answer.</p>

<p>"Who is the officer so badly wounded?"</p>

<p>"I dinna ken," repeated he, as gruffly as before; while he
added, in a<br>
louder key, "Stand bock, I tell ye, man! Dinna ye see the staff
coming?"</p>

<p>I turned round hastily, and at the same instant several
officers, who<br>
apparently from precaution had dismounted at the end of the
street, were<br>
seen approaching. They came hurriedly forward, but without
speaking. He<br>
who was in advance of the party wore a short, blue cape over an
undress<br>
uniform. The rest were in full regimentals. I had scarcely time
to throw a<br>
passing glance upon him, when the officer I have mentioned as
coming first<br>
called out in a stern voice,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Who are you, sir?"</p>

<p>I started at the sounds; it was not the first time those
accents had been<br>
heard by me.</p>

<p>"Captain O'Malley, Fourteenth Light Dragoons."</p>

<p>"What brings you here, sir? Your regiment is at Caya."</p>

<p>"I have been employed as acting aide-de-camp to General
Crawfurd," said I,<br>
hesitatingly.</p>

<p>"Is that your staff uniform?" said he, as with compressed brow
and stern<br>
look he fixed his eyes upon my coat. Before I had time to reply,
or,<br>
indeed, before I well knew how to do so, a gruff voice from
behind called<br>
out,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Damn me! if that ain't the fellow that led the stormers
through a broken<br>
embrasure! I say, my lord, that's the yeoman I was telling you
of. Is it<br>
not so, sir?" continued he, turning towards me.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. I led a party of the Eighty-eight at the
breach."</p>

<p>"And devilish well you did it, too!" added Picton, for it was
he who<br>
recognized me. "I saw him, my lord, spring down from the parapet
upon a<br>
French gunner, and break his sword as he cleft his helmet in two.
Yes, yes;<br>
I shall not forget in a hurry how you laid about you with the
rammer of the<br>
gun! By Jove! that's it he has in his hand!"</p>

<p>While Picton ran thus hurriedly on, Lord Wellington's calm but
stern<br>
features never changed their expression. The looks of those
around were<br>
bent upon me with interest and even admiration; but his evinced
nothing of<br>
either.</p>

<p>Reverting at once to my absence from my post, he asked
me,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Did you obtain leave for a particular service, sir?"</p>

<p>"No, my lord. It was simply from an accidental circumstance
that&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Then, report yourself at your quarters as under arrest."</p>

<p>"But, my lord&mdash;" said Picton. Lord Wellington waited not for
the<br>
explanation, but walked firmly forward, and strode into the
church. The<br>
staff followed in silence, Picton turning one look of kindness on
me as he<br>
went, as though to say, "I'll not forget you."</p>

<p>"The devil take it," cried I, as I found myself once more
alone, "but<br>
I'm unlucky! What would turn out with other men the very basis of
their<br>
fortune, is ever with me the source of ill-luck."</p>

<p>It was evident, from Picton's account, that I had
distinguished myself<br>
in the breach; and yet nothing was more clear than that my
conduct had<br>
displeased the commander-in-chief. Picturing him ever to my
mind's eye as<br>
the <i>beau id&eacute;al</i> of a military leader, by some fatality of
fortune I was<br>
continually incurring his displeasure, for whose praise I would
have<br>
risked my life. "And this confounded costume&mdash;What, in the name
of every<br>
absurdity, could have ever persuaded me to put it on. What
signifies it,<br>
though a man should cover himself with glory, if in the end he is
to be<br>
laughed at? Well, well, it matters not much, now my soldiering's
over! And<br>
yet I could have wished that the last act of my campaigning had
brought<br>
with it pleasanter recollections."</p>

<p>As thus I ruminated, the click of the soldier's musket near
aroused me:<br>
Picton was passing out. A shade of gloom and depression was
visible upon<br>
his features, and his lip trembled as he muttered some sentences
to<br>
himself.</p>

<p>"Ha! Captain&mdash;I forget the name. Yes, Captain O'Malley; you
are released<br>
from arrest. General Crawfurd has spoken very well of you, and
Lord<br>
Wellington has heard the circumstances of your case."</p>

<p>"Is it General Crawfurd, then, that is wounded, sir?" said I,
eagerly.</p>

<p>Picton paused for a moment, while, with an effort, he
controlled his<br>
features into their stern and impassive expression, then added
hurriedly<br>
and almost harshly:&mdash;</p>

<p>Yes, sir; badly wounded through the arm and in the lung. He
mentioned you<br>
to the notice of the commander-in-chief, and your application for
leave is<br>
granted. In fact, you are to have the distinguished honor of
carrying back<br>
despatches. There, now; you had better join your brigade."</p>

<p>"Could I not see my general once more? It may be for the last
time."</p>

<p>"No, sir!" sternly replied Picton. "Lord Wellington believes
you under<br>
arrest. It is as well he should suppose you obeyed his
orders."</p>

<p>There was a tone of sarcasm in these words that prevented my
reply; and<br>
muttering my gratitude for his well-timed and kindly interference
in my<br>
behalf, I bowed deeply and turned away.</p>

<p>"I say, sir!" said Picton, as he returned towards the church,
"should<br>
anything befall,&mdash;that is, if, unfortunately, circumstances
should make you<br>
in want and desirous of a staff appointment, remember that you
are known to<br>
General Picton."</p>

<p>Downcast and depressed by the news of my poor general, I
wended my way with<br>
slow and uncertain steps towards the rampart. A clear, cold,
wintry sky and<br>
a sharp, bracing air made my wound, slight as it was, more
painful, and<br>
I endeavored to reach the reserves, where I knew the
hospital-staff had<br>
established, for the present, their quarters. I had not gone far
when, from<br>
a marauding party, I learned that my man Mike was in search of me
through<br>
the plain. A report of my death had reached him, and the poor
fellow was<br>
half distracted.</p>

<p>Longing anxiously to allay his fears on my account, which I
well knew<br>
might lead him into any act of folly or insanity, I pressed
forward;<br>
besides&mdash;shall I confess it?&mdash;amidst the manifold thoughts of
sorrow and<br>
affliction which weighed me down, I could not divest myself of
the feeling<br>
that so long as I wore my present absurd costume, I could be
nothing but an<br>
object of laughter and ridicule to all who met me.</p>

<p>I had not long to look for my worthy follower, for I soon
beheld him<br>
cantering about the plain. A loud shout brought him beside me;
and<br>
truly the poor fellow's delight was great and sincere. With a
thousand<br>
protestations of his satisfaction, and reiterated assurances of
what he<br>
would not have done to the French prisoners if anything had
happened me, we<br>
took our way together towards the camp.</p>

<br><br><br><br><p>CHAPTER XXXVII.</p>

<p>THE DESPATCH.</p>

<p>I was preparing to visit the town on the following morning,
when my<br>
attention was attracted by a dialogue which took place beneath my
window.</p>

<p>"I say, my good friend," cried a mounted orderly to Mike, who
was busily<br>
employed in brushing a jacket,&mdash;"I say, are you Captain
O'Malley's man?"</p>

<p>"The least taste in life o' that same," replied he, with a
half-jocular<br>
expression.</p>

<p>"Well, then," said the other, "take up these letters to your
master. Be<br>
alive, my fine fellow, for they are despatches, and I must have a
written<br>
return for them."</p>

<p>"Won't ye get off and take a drop of somethin' refreshing; the
air is cowld<br>
this morning."</p>

<p>"I can't stay, my good friend, but thank you all the same; so
be alive,<br>
will you?"</p>

<p>"Arrah, there's no hurry in life. Sure, it's an invitation to
dinner to<br>
Lord Wellington or a tea-party at Sir Denny's; sure, my master's
bothered<br>
with them every day o' th' week: that's the misfortune of being
an<br>
agreeable creature; and I'd be led into dissipation myself, if I
wasn't<br>
rear'd prudent."</p>

<p>"Well, come along, take these letters, for I must be off; my
time is<br>
short."</p>

<p>"That's more nor your nose is, honey," said Mike, evidently
piqued at the<br>
little effect his advances had produced upon the Englishman.
"Give them<br>
here," continued he, while he turned the various papers in every
direction,<br>
affecting to read their addresses.</p>

<p>"There's nothing for me here, I see. Did none of the generals
ask after<br>
me?"</p>

<p>"You <i>are</i> a queer one!" said the dragoon, not a little
puzzled what to<br>
make of him.</p>

<p>Mike meanwhile thrust the papers carelessly into his pocket,
and strode<br>
into the house, whistling a quick-step as he went, with the air
of a man<br>
perfectly devoid of care or occupation. The next moment, however,
he<br>
appeared at my door, wiping his forehead with the back of his
hand, and<br>
apparently breathless with haste.</p>

<p>"Despatches, Mister Charles, despatches from Lord Wellington.
The orderly<br>
is waiting below for a return."</p>

<p>"Tell him he shall have it in one moment," replied I. "And now
bring me a<br>
light."</p>

<p>Before I had broken the seal of the envelope, Mike was once
more at the<br>
porch.</p>

<p>"My master is writing a few lines to say he'll do it. Don't be
talking<br>
of it," added he, dropping his voice, "but they want him to take
another<br>
fortress."</p>

<p>What turn the dialogue subsequently took, I cannot say, for I
was entirely<br>
occupied by a letter which accompanied the despatches. It ran as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>    QUARTER-GENERAL,</p>

<p>    CIUDAD RODRIGO, Jan. 20, 1812.</p>

<p>    Dear Sir,&mdash;The commander-in-chief has been kind enough to
accord you<br>
    the leave of absence you applied for, and takes the
opportunity<br>
    of your return to England to send you the accompanying
letters<br>
    for his Royal Highness the Duke of York. To his approval
of<br>
    your conduct in the assault last night you owe this
distinguished<br>
    mark of Lord Wellington's favor, which, I hope, will be
duly<br>
    appreciated by you, and serve to increase your zeal for that
service<br>
    in which you have already distinguished yourself.</p>

<p>    Believe me that I am most happy in being made the medium
of<br>
    this communication, and have the honor to be,</p>

<p>    Very truly yours,</p>

<p>    T. PICTON.</p>

<p>I read and re-read this note again and again. Every line was
conned over by<br>
me, and every phrase weighed and balanced in my mind. Nothing
could be more<br>
gratifying, nothing more satisfactory to my feelings; and I would
not have<br>
exchanged its possession for the brevet of a
lieutenant-colonel.</p>

<p>"Halloo, Orderly!" cried I, from the window, as I hurriedly
sealed my few<br>
words of acknowledgment, "take this note back to General Picton,
and here's<br>
a guinea for yourself." So saying, I pitched into his ready hand
one of the<br>
very few which remained to me in the world. "This is, indeed,
good news!"<br>
said I, to myself. "This is, indeed, a moment of unmixed
happiness!"</p>

<p>As I closed the window, I could hear Mike pronouncing a
glowing eulogium<br>
upon my liberality, from which he could not, however, help in
some degree<br>
detracting, as he added:</p>

<p>"But the devil thank him, after all! Sure, it's himself has
the illigant<br>
fortune and the fine place of it!"</p>

<p>Scarcely were the last sounds of the retiring horseman dying
away in the<br>
distance, when Mike's meditations took another form, and he
muttered<br>
between his teeth, "Oh, holy Agatha! a guinea, a raal gold guinea
to a<br>
thief of a dragoon that come with the letter, and here am I
wearing a<br>
picture of the holy family for a back to my waistcoat, all out of
economy;<br>
and sure, God knows, but may be they'll take their dealing trick
out of<br>
me in purgatory for this hereafter; and faith, it's a beautiful
pair of<br>
breeches I'd have had, if I wasn't ashamed to put the twelve
apostles on<br>
my legs."</p>

<p>While Mike ran on at this rate, my eyes fell upon a few lines
of postscript<br>
in Picton's letter, which I had not previously noticed.</p>

<p>    "The official despatches of the storming are, of course,
intrusted to<br>
    senior officers, but I need scarcely remind you that it will
be a<br>
    polite and proper attention to his Royal Highness to present
your<br>
    letters with as little delay as possible. Not a moment is to
be lost<br>
    on your landing in England."</p>

<p>"Mike!" cried I, "how look the cattle for a journey?"</p>

<p>"The chestnut is a little low in flesh, but in great wind,
your honor; and<br>
the black horse is jumping like a filly."</p>

<p>"And Badger?" said I.</p>

<p>"Howld him, if you can, that's all; but it's murthering work
this, carrying<br>
despatches day after day."</p>

<p>"This time, however, Mike, we must not grumble."</p>

<p>"May be it isn't far?"</p>

<p>"Why, as to that, I shall not promise much. I'm bound for
England, Mickey."</p>

<p>"For England!"</p>

<p>"Yes, Mike, and for Ireland."</p>

<p>"For Ireland! whoop!" shouted he, as he shied his cap into one
corner of<br>
the room, the jacket he was brushing into the other, and began
dancing<br>
round the table with no bad imitation of an Indian war dance.</p>

<p>    "How I'll dance like a fairy,<br>
    To see ould Dunleary,<br>
    And think twice ere I leave it to be a dragoon."</p>

<p>"Oh, blessed hour! Isn't it beautiful to think of the
illuminations and<br>
dinners and speeches and shaking of hands, huzzaing, and
hip-hipping. May<br>
be there won't be pictures of us in all the shops,&mdash;Mister
Charles and his<br>
man Mister Free. May be they won't make plays out of us; myself
dressed in<br>
the gray coat with the red cuffs, the cords, the tops, and the
Caroline hat<br>
a little cocked, with a phiz in the side of it." Here he made a
sign with<br>
his expanded fingers to represent a cockade, which he designated
by this<br>
word. "I think I see myself dining with the corporation, and the
Lord Major<br>
of Dublin getting up to propose the health of the hero of El
Bodon, Mr.<br>
Free; and three times three, hurra! hurra! hurra! Musha, but it's
dry I am<br>
gettin' with the thoughts of the punch and the poteen negus."</p>

<p>"If you go on at this rate, we're not likely to be soon at our
journey's<br>
end. So be alive now; pack up my kit; I shall start by twelve
o'clock."</p>

<p>With one spring Mike cleared the stairs, and overthrowing
everything and<br>
everybody in his way, hurried towards the stable, chanting at the
top of<br>
his voice the very poetical strain he had indulged me with a few
minutes<br>
before.</p>

<p>My preparations were rapidly made; a few hurried lines of
leave-taking to<br>
the good fellows I had lived so much with and felt so strongly
attached to,<br>
with a firm assurance that I should join them again ere long, was
all<br>
that my time permitted. To Power I wrote more at length,
detailing the<br>
circumstances which my own letters informed me of, and also those
which<br>
invited me to return home. This done, I lost not another moment,
but set<br>
out upon my journey.</p>

<br><br><br><br><p>CHAPTER XXXVIII.</p>

<p>THE LEAVE.</p>

<p>After an hour's sharp riding we reached the Aguada, where the
river was yet<br>
fordable; crossing this, we mounted the Sierra by a narrow and
winding pass<br>
which leads through the mountains towards Almeida. Here I turned
once more<br>
to cast a last and farewell look at the scene of our late
encounter. It<br>
was but a few hours that I had stood almost on the same spot, and
yet how<br>
altered was all around. The wide plain, then bustling with all
the life and<br>
animation of a large army, was now nearly deserted,&mdash;some
dismounted guns,<br>
some broken-up, dismantled batteries, around which a few
sentinels seemed<br>
to loiter rather than to keep guard; a strong detachment of
infantry could<br>
be seen wending their way towards the fortress, and a confused
mass of<br>
camp-followers, sutlers, and peasants following their steps for
protection<br>
against the pillagers and the still ruder assaults of their own
Guerillas.<br>
The fortress, too, was changed indeed. Those mighty walls before
whose<br>
steep sides the bravest fell back baffled and beaten, were now a
mass of<br>
ruin and decay; the muleteer could be seen driving his mule along
through<br>
the rugged ascent of that breach to win whose top the best blood
of<br>
Albion's chivalry was shed; and the peasant child looked timidly
from those<br>
dark enclosures in the deep fosse below, where perished hundreds
of our<br>
best and bravest. The air was calm, clear, and unclouded; no
smoke obscured<br>
the transparent atmosphere; the cannon had ceased; and the voices
that rang<br>
so late in accents of triumphant victory were stilled in death.
Everything,<br>
indeed, had undergone a mighty change; but nothing brought the
altered<br>
fortunes of the scene so vividly to my mind as when I remembered
that when<br>
last I had seen those walls, the dark shako of the French
grenadiers<br>
peered above their battlements, and now the gay tartan of the
Highlanders<br>
fluttered above them, and the red flag of England waved boldly in
the<br>
breeze.</p>

<p>Up to that moment my sensations were those of unmixed
pleasure. The thought<br>
of my home, my friends, my country, the feeling that I was
returning with<br>
the bronze of the battle upon my cheek, and the voice of praise
still<br>
ringing in my heart,&mdash;these were proud thoughts, and my bosom
heaved short<br>
and quickly as I revolved them; but as I turned my gaze for the
last time<br>
towards the gallant army I was leaving, a pang of sorrow, of
self-reproach,<br>
shot through me, and I could not help feeling how far less
worthily was<br>
I acting in yielding to the impulse of my wishes, than had I
remained to<br>
share the fortunes of the campaign.</p>

<p>So powerfully did these sensations possess me, that I sat
motionless for<br>
some time, uncertain whether to proceed; forgetting that I was
the bearer<br>
of important information, I only remembered that by my own desire
I was<br>
there; my reason but half convinced me that the part I had
adopted was<br>
right and honorable, and more than once my resolution to proceed
hung in<br>
the balance. It was just at this critical moment of my doubts
that Mike,<br>
who had been hitherto behind, came up.</p>

<p>"Is it the upper road, sir?" said he, pointing to a steep and
rugged path<br>
which led by a zigzag ascent towards the crest of the
mountain.</p>

<p>I nodded in reply, when he added:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Doesn't this remind your honor of Sleibh More, above the
Shannon, where we<br>
used to be grouse shooting? And there's the keeper's house in the
valley;<br>
and that might be your uncle, the master himself, waving his hat
to you."</p>

<p>Had he known the state of my conflicting feelings at the
moment, he could<br>
not more readily have decided this doubt. I turned abruptly away,
put<br>
spurs to my horse, and dashed up the steep pass at a pace which
evidently<br>
surprised, and as evidently displeased, my follower.</p>

<p>How natural it is ever to experience a reaction of depression
and lowness<br>
after the first burst of unexpected joy! The moment of happiness
is<br>
scarce experienced ere come the doubts of its reality, the fears
for its<br>
continuance; the higher the state of pleasurable excitement, the
more<br>
painful and the more pressing the anxieties that await on it; the
tension<br>
of delighted feelings cannot last, and our overwrought faculties
seek<br>
repose in regrets. Happy he who can so temper his enjoyments as
to view<br>
them in their shadows as in their sunshine; he may not, it is
true, behold<br>
the landscape in the blaze of its noonday brightness, but he need
not fear<br>
the thunder-cloud nor the hurricane. The calm autumn of <i>his</i>
bliss, if it<br>
dazzle not in its brilliancy, will not any more be shrouded in
darkness and<br>
in gloom.</p>

<p>My first burst of pleasure over, the thought of my uncle's
changed fortunes<br>
pressed deeply on my heart, and a hundred plans suggested
themselves in<br>
turn to my mind to relieve his present embarrassments; but I knew
how<br>
impracticable they would all prove when opposed by his
prejudices. To<br>
sell the old home of his forefathers, to wander from the roof
which had<br>
sheltered his name for generations, he would never consent to;
the law<br>
might by force expel him, and drive him a wanderer and an exile,
but of<br>
his own free will the thing was hopeless. Considine, too, would
encourage<br>
rather than repress such feelings; his feudalism would lead him
to any<br>
lengths; and in defence of what he would esteem a right, he would
as soon<br>
shoot a sheriff as a snipe, and, old as he was, ask for no better
amusement<br>
than to arm the whole tenantry and give battle to the king's
troops on the<br>
wide plain of Scariff. Amidst such conflicting thought, I
travelled on<br>
moodily and in silence, to the palpable astonishment of Mike, who
could not<br>
help regarding me as one from whom fortune met the most
ungrateful returns.<br>
At every new turn of the road he would endeavor to attract my
attention by<br>
the objects around,&mdash;no white-turreted ch&acirc;teau, no tapered
spire in the<br>
distance, escaped him; he kept up a constant ripple of
half-muttered praise<br>
and censure upon all he saw, and instituted unceasing comparisons
between<br>
the country and his own, in which, I am bound to say, Ireland
rarely, if<br>
ever, had to complain of his patriotism.</p>

<p>When we arrived at Almeida, I learned that the "Medea"
sloop-of-war was<br>
lying off Oporto, and expected to sail for England in a few days.
The<br>
opportunity was not to be neglected. The official despatches, I
was aware,<br>
would be sent through Lisbon, where the "Gorgon" frigate was in
waiting to<br>
convey them; but should I be fortunate enough to reach Oporto in
time, I<br>
had little doubt of arriving in England with the first
intelligence of the<br>
fall of Ciudad Rodrigo. Reducing my luggage, therefore, to the
smallest<br>
possible compass, and having provided myself with a juvenile
guide for the<br>
pass of La Reyna, I threw myself, without undressing, upon the
bed, and<br>
waited anxiously for the break of day to resume my journey.</p>

<p>As I ruminated over the prospect my return presented, I
suddenly remembered<br>
Frank Webber's letter, which I had hastily thrust into a
portfolio without<br>
reading, so occupied was I by Considine's epistle; with a little
searching<br>
I discovered it, and trimming my lamp, as I felt no inclination
to sleep, I<br>
proceeded to the examination of what seemed a more than usually
voluminous<br>
epistle. It contained four closely-written pages, accompanied by
something<br>
like a plan in an engineering sketch. My curiosity becoming
further<br>
stimulated by this, I sat down to peruse it. It began thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>    Official Despatch of Lieutenant-General Francis Webber to
Lord<br>
    Castlereagh, detailing the assault and capture of the old
pump, in<br>
    Trinity College, Dublin, on the night of the second of
December,<br>
    eighteen hundred and eleven, with returns of killed,
wounded,<br>
    and missing, with other information from the seat of war.</p>

<p>    HEADQUARTERS, No. 2, OLD SQUARE.</p>

<p>    My Lord,&mdash;In compliance with the instructions contained in
your<br>
    lordship's despatch of the twenty-first ultimo, I
concentrated the<br>
    force under my command, and assembling the generals of
division,<br>
    made known my intentions in the following general
order:&mdash;</p>

<p>      A. G. O.</p>

<p>      The following troops will this evening assemble at
headquarters, and<br>
      having partaken of a sufficient dinner for the next two
days, with<br>
      punch for four, will hold themselves in readiness to march
in the<br>
      following order:&mdash;</p>

<p>      Harry Nesbitt's Brigade of Incorrigibles will form a
blockading<br>
      force, in the line extending from the vice-provost's house
to the<br>
      library. The light division, under Mark Waller, will
skirmish from<br>
      the gate towards the middle of the square, obstructing the
march of<br>
      the Cuirassiers of the Guard, which, under the command of
old Duncan<br>
      the porter, are expected to move in that direction. Two
columns of<br>
      attack will be formed by the senior sophisters of the Old
Guard, and<br>
      a forlorn hope of the "cautioned" men at the last four
examinations<br>
      will form, under the orders of Timothy O'Rourke, beneath
the shadow<br>
      of the dining-hall.</p>

<p>      At the signal of the dean's bell the stormers will move
forward. A<br>
      cheer from the united corps will then announce the moment
of attack.</p>

<p>      The word for the night will be, "May the Devil admire
me!"</p>

<p>      The commander-of-the-forces desires that the different
corps should<br>
      be as strong as possible, and expects that no man will
rema<br>
      any pretence whatever, in the rear with the lush. During
the main<br>
      assault, Cecil Cavendish will make a feint upon the
provost's<br>
      windows, to be converted into a real attack if the ladies
scream.</p>

<p>      GENERAL ORDER.</p>

<p>      The commissary-general, Foley, will supply the following
articles for<br>
      the use of the troops: Two hams; eight pair of chickens,
the same to<br>
      be roasted; a devilled turkey; sixteen lobsters; eight
hundred of<br>
      oysters, with a proportionate quantity of cold sherry and
hot punch.</p>

<p>      The army will get drunk by ten o'clock to-night.</p>

<p>    Having made these dispositions, my lord, I proceeded to
mislead<br>
    the enemy as to our intentions, in suffering my servant to be
taken<br>
    with an intercepted despatch. This, being a prescription by
Doctor<br>
    Colles, would convey to the dean's mind the impression that I
was<br>
    still upon the sick list. This being done, and four canisters
of<br>
    Dartford gunpowder being procured on tick, our military chest
being in<br>
    a most deplorable condition, I waited for the moment of
attack.</p>

<p>    A heavy rain, accompanied with a frightful hurricane,
prevailed<br>
    during the entire day, rendering the march of the troops who
came<br>
    from the neighborhood of Merrion Square and Fitzwilliam
Street, a<br>
    service of considerable fatigue. The outlying pickets in
College Green,<br>
    being induced probably by the inclemency of the season, were
rather<br>
    tipsy on joining, and having engaged in a skirmish with old
M'Calister,<br>
    tying his red uniform over his head, the moment of attack<br>
    was precipitated, and we moved to the trenches by half-past
nine<br>
    o'clock.</p>

<p>    Nothing could be more orderly, nothing more perfect, than
the<br>
    march of the troops. As we approached the corner of the
commons-hall,<br>
    a skirmish on the rear apprised us that our intentions had
become<br>
    known; and I soon learned from my aide-de-camp, Bob
Moore,<br>
    that the attack was made by a strong column of the enemy,
under<br>
    the command of old Fitzgerald.</p>

<p>    Perpendicular (as your lordship is aware he is styled by
the army)<br>
    came on in a determined manner, and before many minutes
had<br>
    elapsed had taken several prisoners, among others Tom
Drummond,&mdash;Long<br>
    Tom,&mdash;who, having fallen on all fours, was mistaken for a<br>
    long eighteen. The success, however, was but momentary;
Nesbitt's<br>
    Brigade attacked them in flank, rescued the prisoners,
extinguished<br>
    the dean's lantern, and having beaten back the heavy porters,
took<br>
    Perpendicular himself prisoner.</p>

<p>    An express from the left informed me that the attack upon
the<br>
    provost's house had proved equally successful; there wasn't a
whole<br>
    pane of glass in the front, and from a footman who deserted,
it was<br>
    learned that Mrs. Hutchinson was in hysterics.</p>

<p>    While I was reading this despatch, a strong feeling of the
line<br>
    towards the right announced that something was taking place
in that<br>
    direction. Bob Moore, who rode by on Drummond's back,
hurriedly<br>
    informed me that Williams had put the lighted end of his
cigar to<br>
    one of the fuses, but the powder, being wet, did not
explode<br>
    notwithstanding his efforts to effect it. Upon this, I
hastened to the<br>
    front, where I found the individual in question kneeling upon
the<br>
    ground, and endeavoring, as far as punch would permit him, to
kindle a<br>
    flame at the portfire. Before I could interfere, the spark
had caught;<br>
    a loud, hissing noise followed; the different magazines
successively<br>
    became ignited, and at length the fire reached the great
four-pound<br>
    charge.</p>

<p>    I cannot convey to your lordship, by any words of mine, an
idea of<br>
    this terrible explosion; the blazing splinters were hurled
into the<br>
    air, and fell in fiery masses on every side from the park to
King<br>
    William; Ivey the bell-ringer, was precipitated from the
scaffold<br>
    beside the bell, and fell headlong into the mud beneath;
the<br>
    surrounding buildings trembled at the shock; the windows
were<br>
    shattered, and in fact a scene of perfect devastation ensued
on all<br>
    sides.</p>

<p>    When the smoke cleared away, I rose from my recumbent
position,<br>
    and perceived with delight that not a vestige of the pump
remained.<br>
    The old iron handle was imbedded in the wall of the
dining-hall, and<br>
    its round knob stood out like the end of a queue.</p>

<p>    Our loss was, of course, considerable; and ordering the
wounded<br>
    to the rear, I proceeded to make an orderly and regular
retreat. At<br>
    this time, however, the enemy had assembled in force. Two
battalions<br>
    of porters, led on by Dr. Dobbin, charged us on the flank;
a<br>
    heavy brigade poured down upon us from the battery, and but
for<br>
    the exertions of Harry Nesbitt, our communication with our
reserves<br>
    must have been cut off. Cecil Cavendish also came up; for
although<br>
    beaten in his great attack, the forces under his command had
penetrated<br>
    by the kitchen windows, and carried oil a considerable
quantity<br>
    of cold meat.</p>

<p>    Concentrating the different corps, I made an echelon
movement<br>
    upon the chapel, to admit of the light division coming up.
This they<br>
    did in a few moments, informing me that they had left
Perpendicular<br>
    in the haha, which, as your lordship is aware, is a fosse of
the<br>
    very greenest and most stagnant nature. We now made good our
retreat<br>
    upon number "2," carrying our wounded with us. The
plunder<br>
    we also secured; but we kicked the prisoners, and suffered
them to<br>
    escape.</p>

<p>    Thus terminated, my lord, one of the brightest
achievements of the<br>
    undergraduate career. I enclose a list of the wounded, as
also an<br>
    account of the various articles returned in the
commissary-general's<br>
    list.</p>

<p>    Harry Nesbitt: severely wounded; no coat nor hat; a
black-eye;<br>
    left shoe missing.</p>

<p>    Cecil Cavendish: face severely scratched; supposed to have
received<br>
    his wound in the attack upon the kitchen.</p>

<p>    Tom Drummond: not recognizable by his friends; his
features<br>
    resembling a transparency disfigured by the smoke of the
preceding<br>
    night's illumination.</p>

<p>    Bob Moore: slightly wounded.</p>

<p>    I would beg particularly to recommend all these officers
to your<br>
    lordship's notice; indeed, the conduct of Moore, in kicking
the dean's<br>
    lantern out of the porter's hand, was marked by great
promptitude<br>
    and decision. This officer will present to H. R. H. the
following<br>
    trophies, taken from the enemy: The dean's cap and tassel;
the key<br>
    of his chambers; Dr. Dobbin's wig and bands; four porters'
helmets,<br>
    and a book on the cellar.</p>

<p>    I have the honor to remain, my lord, etc.,</p>

<p>    FRANCIS WEBBER.</p>

<p>      G. O.</p>

<p>      The commander-of-the-forces returns his thanks to the
various<br>
      officers and soldiers employed in the late assault, for
their<br>
      persevering gallantry and courage. The splendor of the
achievement<br>
      can only be equalled by the humanity and good conduct of
the troops.<br>
      It only remains for him to add, that the less they say
about the<br>
      transaction, and the sooner they are severally confined to
their beds<br>
      with symptoms of contagious fever, the better.</p>

<p>      Meanwhile, to concert upon the future measures of the
campaign, the<br>
      army will sup to-night at Morrison's.</p>

<p>Here ended this precious epistle, rendering one fact
sufficiently<br>
evident,&mdash;that, however my worthy friend advanced in years, he
had not<br>
grown in wisdom.</p>

<p>While ruminating upon the strange infatuation which could
persuade a gifted<br>
and an able man to lavish upon dissipation and reckless absurdity
the<br>
talents that must, if well directed, raise him to eminence and
distinction,<br>
a few lines of a newspaper paragraph fell from the paper I was
reading. It<br>
ran thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>      LATE OUTRAGE IN TRINITY COLLEGE, DUBLIN.</p>

<p>      We have great pleasure in stating that the serious
disturbance which<br>
      took place within the walls of our University a few
evenings since,<br>
      was in no wise attributable to the conduct of the students.
A party<br>
      of ill-disposed townspeople were, it would appear, the
instigators<br>
      and perpetrators of the outrage. That their object was the
total<br>
      destruction of our venerated University there can be but
little<br>
      doubt. Fortunately, however, they did not calculate upon
the <i>esprit<br>
      de corps</i> of the students, a body of whom, under the
direction of Mr.<br>
      Webber, successfully opposed the assailants, and finally
drove them<br>
      from the walls.</p>

<p>      It is, we understand, the intention of the board to
confer some mark<br>
      of approbation upon Mr. Webber, who, independently of this,
has<br>
      strong claims upon their notice, his collegiate success
pointing him<br>
      out as the most extraordinary man of his day.</p>

<p>    This, my dear Charley, will give you some faint conception
of one<br>
    of the most brilliant exploits of modern days. The bulletin,
believe<br>
    me, is not Napoleonized into any bombastic extravagance of
success.<br>
    The tiling was splendid; from the brilliant firework of the
old pump<br>
    itself, to the figure of Perpendicular dripping with
duckweed, like<br>
    an insane river-god, it was unequalled. Our fellows behaved
like<br>
    trumps; and to do them justice, so did the enemy. But
unfortunately,<br>
    notwithstanding this, and the plausible paragraphs of the<br>
    morning papers, I have been summoned before the board for
Tuesday<br>
    next.</p>

<p>    Meanwhile I employ myself in throwing off a shower of
small<br>
    squibs for the journals, so that if the board deal not
mercifully with<br>
    me, I may meet with sympathy from the public. I have just
despatched<br>
    a little editorial bit for the "Times," calling, in terms
of<br>
    parental tenderness, upon the University to say&mdash;</p>

<p>      "How long will the extraordinary excesses of a learned
funct<br>
      be suffered to disgrace college? Is Doctor &mdash;&mdash; to be
permitted to<br>
      exhibit an example of more riotous insubordination than
would be<br>
      endured in an undergraduate? More on this subject
hereafter."</p>

<p>      "'Saunders' News-letter.'&mdash;Dr. Barret appeared at the
head<br>
      police-office, before Alderman Darley, to make oath that
neither he<br>
      nor Catty were concerned in the late outrage upon the
pump." etc.,<br>
      etc.</p>

<p>    Paragraphs like these are flying about in every provincial
paper of<br>
    the empire. People shake their heads when they speak of the
University,<br>
    and respectable females rather cross over by King William
and<br>
    the Bank than pass near its precincts.</p>

<p>    Tuesday Evening.</p>

<p>    Would you believe it, they've expelled me! Address your
next<br>
    letter as usual, for they haven't got rid of me yet.</p>

<p>    Yours,                   F. W.</p>

<p>"So I shall find him in his old quarters," thought I, "and
evidently not<br>
much altered since we parted." It was not without a feeling of (I
trust<br>
pardonable) pride that I thought over my own career in the
interval. My<br>
three years of campaigning life had given me some insight into
the world,<br>
and some knowledge of myself, and conferred upon me a boon, of
which I know<br>
not the equal,&mdash;that, while yet young, and upon the very
threshold of life,<br>
I should have tasted the enthusiastic pleasures of a soldier's
fortune, and<br>
braved the dangers and difficulties of a campaign at a time when,
under<br>
other auspices, I might have wasted my years in unprofitable
idleness or<br>
careless dissipation.</p>

<br><br><br><br><p>CHAPTER XXXIX.</p>

<p>LONDON.</p>

<p>Twelve hours after my arrival in England I entered London. I
cannot attempt<br>
to record the sensations which thronged my mind as the din and
tumult of<br>
that mighty city awoke me from a sound sleep I had fallen into in
the<br>
corner of the chaise. The seemingly interminable lines of
lamplight, the<br>
crash of carriages, the glare of the shops, the buzz of voices,
made up a<br>
chaotic mass of sights and sounds, leaving my efforts at thought
vain and<br>
fruitless.</p>

<p>Obedient to my instructions, I lost not a moment in my
preparations to<br>
deliver my despatches. Having dressed myself in the full uniform
of my<br>
corps, I drove to the Horse Guards. It was now nine o'clock, and
I learned<br>
that his Royal Highness had gone to dinner at Carlton House. In a
few words<br>
which I spoke with the aide-de-camp, I discovered that no
information of<br>
the fall of Ciudad Rodrigo had yet reached England. The greatest
anxiety<br>
prevailed as to the events of the Peninsula, from which no
despatches had<br>
been received for several weeks past.</p>

<p>To Carlton House I accordingly bent my steps, without any
precise<br>
determination how I should proceed when there, nor knowing how
far<br>
etiquette might be an obstacle to the accomplishment of my
mission. The<br>
news of which I was the bearer was, however, of too important a
character<br>
to permit me to hesitate, and I presented myself to the
aide-de-camp in<br>
waiting, simply stating that I was intrusted with important
letters to his<br>
Royal Highness, the purport of which did not admit of delay.</p>

<p>"They have not gone to dinner yet," lisped out the
aide-de-camp, "and if<br>
you would permit me to deliver the letters&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Mine are despatches," said I, somewhat proudly, and in no way
disposed to<br>
cede to another the honor of personally delivering them into the
hands of<br>
the duke.</p>

<p>"Then you had better present yourself at the levee to-morrow
morning,"<br>
replied he, carelessly, while he turned into one of the window
recesses,<br>
and resumed the conversation with one of the
gentlemen-in-waiting.</p>

<p>I stood for some moments uncertain and undecided; reluctant on
the one<br>
part to relinquish my claim as the bearer of the despatches, and
equally<br>
unwilling to defer their delivery till the following day.</p>

<p>Adopting the former alternative, I took my papers from my
sabretasche,<br>
and was about to place them in the hands of the aide-de-camp,
when the<br>
folding-doors at the end of the apartment suddenly flew open, and
a large<br>
and handsome man with a high bald forehead entered hastily.</p>

<p>The different persons in waiting sprang from their lounging
attitudes upon<br>
the sofas, and bowed respectfully as he passed on towards another
door.<br>
His dress was a plain blue coat, buttoned to the collar, and his
only<br>
decoration a brilliant star upon the breast. There was that air,
however,<br>
of high birth and bearing about him that left no doubt upon my
mind he was<br>
of the blood royal.</p>

<p>As the aide-de-camp to whom I had been speaking opened the
door for him to<br>
pass out, I could hear some words in a low voice, in which the
phrases,<br>
"letters of importance" and "your Royal Highness" occurred. The
individual<br>
addressed turned suddenly about, and casting a rapid glance
around the<br>
room, without deigning a word in reply, walked straight up to
where I was<br>
standing.</p>

<p>"Despatches for me, sir?" said he, shortly, taking, as he
spoke, the packet<br>
from my hand.</p>

<p>"For his Royal Highness the commander-in-chief," said I,
bowing<br>
respectfully, and still uncertain in whose presence I was
standing. He<br>
broke the seal without answering, and as his eye caught the first
lines of<br>
the despatch, broke out into an exclamation of&mdash;</p>

<p>Ha, Peninsular news! When did you arrive, sir?"</p>

<p>"An hour since, sir."</p>

<p>"And these letters are from&mdash;"</p>

<p>"General Picton, your Royal Highness."</p>

<p>"How glorious! How splendidly done!" muttered he to himself,
as he ran his<br>
eyes rapidly over the letter. "Are you Captain O'Malley, whose
name is<br>
mentioned here so favorably?"</p>

<p>I bowed deeply in reply.</p>

<p>"You are most highly spoken of, and it will give me sincere
pleasure to<br>
recommend you to the notice of the Prince Regent. But stay a
moment," so<br>
saying, he hurriedly passed from the room, leaving me overwhelmed
at the<br>
suddenness of the incident, and a mark of no small astonishment
to the<br>
different persons in waiting, who had hitherto no other idea but
that my<br>
despatches were from Hounslow or Knightsbridge.</p>

<p>"Captain O'Malley," said an officer covered with decorations,
and whose<br>
slightly foreign accent bespoke the Hanoverian, "his Royal
Highness<br>
requests you will accompany me." The door opened as he spoke, and
I found<br>
myself in a most splendidly lit-up apartment,&mdash;the walls covered
with<br>
pictures, and the ceiling divided, into panels resplendent with
the richest<br>
gilding. A group of persons in court dresses were conversing in a
low tone<br>
as we entered, but suddenly ceased, and saluting my conductor
respectfully,<br>
made way for us to pass on. The folding-doors again opened as
we<br>
approached, and we found ourselves in a long gallery, whose
sumptuous<br>
furniture and costly decorations shone beneath the rich tints of
a massive<br>
lustre of ruby glass, diffusing a glow resembling the most
gorgeous sunset.<br>
Here also some persons in handsome uniform were conversing, one
of whom<br>
accosted my companion by the title of "Baron;" nodding familiarly
as he<br>
muttered a few words in German, he passed forward, and the next
moment the<br>
doors were thrown suddenly wide, and we entered the
drawing-room.</p>

<p>The buzz of voices and the sound of laughter reassured me as I
came<br>
forward, and before I had well time to think where and why I was
there, the<br>
Duke of York advanced towards me, with a smile of peculiar
sweetness in its<br>
expression, and said, as he turned towards one side:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Your Royal Highness&mdash;Captain O'Malley!"</p>

<p>As he spoke the Prince moved forward, and bowed slightly.</p>

<p>"You've brought us capital news, Mr. O'Malley. May I beg, if
you're not<br>
too much tired, you'll join us at dinner. I am most anxious to
learn the<br>
particulars of the assault."</p>

<p>As I bowed my acknowledgments to the gracious invitation, he
continued:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Are you acquainted with my friend here?&mdash;but of course you
can scarcely<br>
be; you began too early as a soldier. So let me present you to my
friend,<br>
Mr. Tierney," a middle-aged man, whose broad, white forehead and
deep-set<br>
eyes gave a character to features that were otherwise not
remarkable in<br>
expression, and who bowed rather stiffly.</p>

<p>Before he had concluded a somewhat labored compliment to me,
we were joined<br>
by a third person, whose strikingly-handsome features were lit up
with an<br>
expression of the most animated kind. He accosted the Prince with
an air<br>
of easy familiarity, and while he led him from the group,
appeared to be<br>
relating some anecdote which actually convulsed his Royal
Highness with<br>
laughter.</p>

<p>Before I had time or opportunity to inquire who the individual
could<br>
be, dinner was announced, and the wide folding-doors being thrown
open,<br>
displayed the magnificent dining-room of Carlton House in all the
blaze and<br>
splendor of its magnificence.</p>

<p>The sudden change from the rough vicissitudes of campaigning
life to all<br>
the luxury and voluptuous elegance of a brilliant court, created
too much<br>
confusion in my mind to permit of my impressions being the most
accurate<br>
or most collected. The splendor of the scene, the rank, but even
more the<br>
talent of the individuals by whom I was surrounded, had all their
full<br>
effect upon me. And although I found, from the tone of the
conversation<br>
about, how immeasurably I was their inferior, yet by a delicate
and<br>
courteous interest in the scene of which I had lately partaken,
they took<br>
away the awkwardness which in some degree was inseparable from
the novelty<br>
of my position among them.</p>

<p>Conversing about the Peninsula with a degree of knowledge
which I could<br>
in no wise comprehend from those not engaged in the war, they
appeared<br>
perfectly acquainted with all the details of the campaign; and I
heard on<br>
every side of me anecdotes and stories which I scarcely believed
known<br>
beyond the precincts of a regiment. The Prince himself&mdash;the grace
and charm<br>
of whose narrative talents have seldom been excelled&mdash;was
particularly<br>
conspicuous, and I could not help feeling struck with his
admirable<br>
imitations of voice and manner. The most accomplished actor could
not have<br>
personated the canny, calculating spirit of the Scot, or the
rollicking<br>
recklessness of the Irishman, with more tact and <i>finesse</i>. But
far above<br>
all this, shone the person I have already alluded to as speaking
to his<br>
Royal Highness in the drawing-room. Combining the happiest
conversational<br>
eloquence with a quick, ready, and brilliant fancy, he threw from
him in<br>
all the careless profusion of boundless resource a shower of
pointed and<br>
epigrammatic witticisms. Now illustrating a really difficult
subject by one<br>
happy touch, as the blaze of the lightning will light up the
whole surface<br>
of the dark landscape beneath it; now turning the force of an
adversary's<br>
argument by some fallacious but unanswerable jest, accompanying
the whole<br>
by those fascinations of voice, look, gesture, and manner which
have made<br>
those who once have seen, never able to forget Brinsley
Sheridan.</p>

<p>I am not able, were I even disposed, to record more
particularly the<br>
details of that most brilliant evening of my life. On every side
of me I<br>
heard the names of those whose fame as statesmen or whose repute
as men of<br>
letters was ringing throughout Europe. They were then, too, not
in the easy<br>
indolence of ordinary life, but displaying with their utmost
effort those<br>
powers of wit, fancy, imagination, and eloquence which had won
for them<br>
elsewhere their high and exalted position. The masculine
understanding<br>
and powerful intellect of Tierney vied with the brilliant and
dazzling<br>
conceptions of Sheridan. The easy <i>bonhomie</i> and English
heartiness of Fox<br>
contrasted with the cutting sarcasm and sharp raillery of
O'Kelly. While<br>
contesting the palm with each himself, the Prince evinced powers
of mind<br>
and eloquent facilities of expression that, in any walk of life,
must<br>
have made their possessor a most distinguished man. Politics,
war, women,<br>
literature, the turf, the navy, the opposition, architecture, and
the<br>
drama, were all discussed with a degree of information and
knowledge that<br>
proved to me how much of real acquirements can be obtained by
those whose<br>
exalted station surrounds them with the collective intellect of a
nation.<br>
As for myself, the time flew past unconsciously. So brilliant a
display of<br>
all that was courtly and fascinating in manner, and all that was
brightest<br>
in genius, was so novel to me, that I really felt like one
entranced. To<br>
this hour, my impression, however confused in details, is as
vivid as<br>
though that evening were but yesternight; and although since that
period<br>
I have enjoyed numerous opportunities of meeting with the great
and the<br>
gifted, yet I treasure the memory of that evening as by far the
most<br>
exciting of my whole life.</p>

<p>While I abstain from any mention of the many incidents of the
evening,<br>
I cannot pass over one which, occurring to myself, is valuable
but as<br>
showing, by one slight and passing trait, the amiable and kind
feeling of<br>
one whose memory is hallowed in the service.</p>

<p>A little lower than myself, on the opposite side of the table,
I perceived<br>
an old military acquaintance whom I had first met in Lisbon. He
was then on<br>
Sir Charles Stewart's staff, and we met almost daily. Wishing to
commend<br>
myself to his recollection, I endeavored for some time to catch
his eye,<br>
but in vain; but at last when I thought I had succeeded, I called
to him,&mdash;</p>

<p>"I say, Fred, a glass of wine with you."</p>

<p>When suddenly the Duke of York, who was speaking to Lord
Hertford, turned<br>
quickly round, and taking the decanter in his hand,
replied,&mdash;</p>

<p>"With pleasure, O'Malley. What shall it be, my boy?"</p>

<p>I shall never forget the manly good-humor of his look as he
sat waiting for<br>
my answer. He had taken my speech as addressed to himself, and
concluding<br>
that from fatigue, the novelty of the scene, my youth, etc., I
was not over<br>
collected, vouchsafed in this kind way to receive it.</p>

<p>"So," said he, as I stammered out my explanation, "I was
deceived. However,<br>
don't cheat me out of my glass of wine. Let us have it now."</p>

<p>With this little anecdote, whose truth I vouch for, I shall
conclude. More<br>
than one now living was a witness to it, and my only regret in
the mention<br>
of it is my inability to convey the readiness with which he
seized the<br>
moment of apparent difficulty to throw the protection of his kind
and<br>
warm-hearted nature over the apparent folly of a boy.</p>

<p>It was late when the party broke up, and as I took my leave of
the Prince,<br>
he once more expressed himself in gracious terms towards me, and
gave<br>
me personally an invitation to a breakfast at Hounslow on the
following<br>
Saturday.</p>

<br><br><br><br><p>CHAPTER XL.</p>

<p>THE BELL AT BRISTOL.</p>

<p>On the morning after my dinner at Carlton House, I found my
breakfast-table<br>
covered with cards and invitations. The news of the storming of
Ciudad<br>
Rodrigo was published in all the morning papers, and my own
humble name, in<br>
letters of three feet long, was exhibited in placards throughout
the city.<br>
Less to this circumstance, however, than to the kind and gracious
notice of<br>
the Prince, was I indebted for the attentions which were shown me
by<br>
every one; and indeed, so flattering was the reception I met
with, and so<br>
overwhelming the civility showered on me from all sides, that it
required<br>
no small effort on my part not to believe myself as much a hero
as they<br>
would make me. An eternal round of dinners, balls, breakfasts,
and<br>
entertainments filled up the entire week. I was included in
every<br>
invitation to Carlton House, and never appeared without receiving
from his<br>
Royal Highness the most striking marks of attention. Captivating
as all<br>
this undoubtedly was, and fascinated as I felt in being the lion
of London,<br>
the courted and sought after by the high, the titled, and the
talented of<br>
the great city of the universe, yet amidst all the splendor and
seduction<br>
of that new world, my heart instinctively turned from the glare
and<br>
brilliancy of gorgeous saloons, from the soft looks and softer
voice of<br>
beauty, from the words of praise as they fell from the lips of
those whose<br>
notice was fame itself,&mdash;to my humble home amidst the mountains
of the<br>
west. Delighted and charmed as I felt by that tribute of flattery
which<br>
associated my name with one of the most brilliant actions of my
country,<br>
yet hitherto I had experienced no touch of home or fatherland.
England was<br>
to me as the high and powerful head of my house, whose greatness
and whose<br>
glory shed a halo far and near, from the proudest to the humblest
of those<br>
that call themselves Britons; but Ireland was-the land of my
birth,&mdash;the<br>
land of my earliest ties, my dearest associations,&mdash;the kind
mother whose<br>
breath had fanned my brow in infancy, and for her in my manhood
my heart<br>
beat with every throb of filial affection. Need I say, then, how
ardently<br>
I longed to turn homeward; for independent of all else, I could
not avoid<br>
some self-reproach on thinking what might be the condition of
those I<br>
prized the most on earth, at that very moment I was engaging in
all the<br>
voluptuous abandonment, and all the fascinating excesses of a
life of<br>
pleasure. I wrote several letters home, but received no answer;
nor did I,<br>
in the whole round of London society, meet with a single person
who could<br>
give me information of my family or my friends. The Easter recess
had sent<br>
the different members of Parliament to their homes; and thus,
within a<br>
comparatively short distance of all I cared for, I could learn
nothing of<br>
their fate.</p>

<p>The invitations of the Prince Regent, which were, of course,
to be regarded<br>
as commands, still detained me in London; and I knew not in what
manner<br>
to escape from the fresh engagements which each day heaped upon
me. In<br>
my anxiety upon the subject, I communicated my wishes to a friend
on the<br>
duke's staff, and the following morning, as I presented myself at
his<br>
levee, he called me towards him and addressed me:&mdash;</p>

<p>"What leave have you got, Captain O'Malley?"</p>

<p>"Three months, your Royal Highness."</p>

<p>"Do you desire an unattached troop; for if so, an opportunity
occurs just<br>
at this moment."</p>

<p>"I thank you most sincerely, sir, for your condescension in
thinking of me;<br>
but my wish is to join my regiment at the expiration of my
leave."</p>

<p>"Why, I thought they told me you wanted to spend some time in
Ireland?"</p>

<p>"Only sufficient to see my friends, your Royal Highness. That
done, I'd<br>
rather join my regiment immediately."</p>

<p>"Ah, that alters the case! So then, probably, you'd like to
leave us at<br>
once. I see how it is; you've been staying here against your will
all this<br>
while. Then, don't say a word. I'll make your excuses at Carlton
House; and<br>
the better to cover your retreat, I'll employ you on service.
Here, Gordon,<br>
let Captain O'Malley have the despatches for Sir Henry Howard, at
Cork." As<br>
he said this, he turned towards me with an air of affected
sternness in his<br>
manner, and continued: "I expect, Captain O'Malley, that you will
deliver<br>
the despatches intrusted to your care without a moment's loss of
time. You<br>
will leave London within an hour. The instructions for your
journey will<br>
be sent to your hotel. And now," said he, again changing his
voice to its<br>
natural tone of kindliness and courtesy,&mdash;"and now, my boy,
good-by, and a<br>
safe journey to you. These letters will pay your expenses, and
the occasion<br>
save you all the worry of leave-taking."</p>

<p>I stood confused and speechless, unable to utter a single word
of gratitude<br>
for such unexpected kindness. The duke saw at once my difficulty,
and as he<br>
shook me warmly by the hand, added, in a laughing tone,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Don't wait, now; you mustn't forget that your despatches are
pressing."</p>

<p>I bowed deeply, attempted a few words of acknowledgment,
hesitated,<br>
blundered, broke down, and at last got out of the room, Heaven
knows how,<br>
and found myself running towards Long's at the top of my speed.
Within that<br>
same hour I was rattling along towards Bristol as fast as four
posters<br>
could burn the pavement, thinking with ecstasy over the pleasures
of my<br>
reception in England; but far more than all, of the kindness
evinced<br>
towards me by him who, in every feeling of his nature, and in
every feature<br>
of his deportment was "every inch a prince."</p>

<p>However astonished I had been at the warmth, by which I was
treated in<br>
London, I was still less prepared for the enthusiasm which
greeted me in<br>
every town through which I passed. There was not a village where
we stopped<br>
to change horses whose inhabitants did not simultaneously pour
forth to<br>
welcome me with every demonstration of delight. That the fact of
four<br>
horses and a yellow chaise should have elicited such testimonies
of<br>
satisfaction, was somewhat difficult to conceive; and even had
the<br>
important news that I was the bearer of despatches been
telegraphed from<br>
London by successive postboys, still the extraordinary excitement
was<br>
unaccountable. It was only on reaching Bristol that I learned to
what<br>
circumstance my popularity was owing. My friend Mike, in humble
imitation<br>
of election practices, had posted a large placard on the back of
the<br>
chaise, announcing, in letters of portentous length, something
like the<br>
following:&mdash;</p>

<p>    "Bloody news! Fall of Ciudad Rodrigo! Five thousand
prisoners<br>
    and two hundred pieces of cannon taken!"</p>

<p>This veracious and satisfactory statement, aided by Mike's
personal<br>
exertions, and an unwearied performance on the trumpet he had
taken from<br>
the French dragoon, had roused the population of every hamlet,
and made our<br>
journey from London to Bristol one scene of uproar, noise, and
confusion.<br>
All my attempts to suppress Mike's oratory or music were
perfectly<br>
unavailing. In fact, he had pledged my health so many times
during the day;<br>
he had drunk so many toasts to the success of the British arms,
so many to<br>
the English nation, so many in honor of Ireland, and so many in
honor of<br>
Mickey Free himself,&mdash;that all respect for my authority was lost
in his<br>
enthusiasm for my greatness, and his shouts became wilder, and
the blasts<br>
from the trumpet more fearful and incoherent; and finally, on the
last<br>
stage of our journey, having exhausted as it were every tribute
of his<br>
lungs, he seemed (if I were to judge by the evidence of my ears)
to be<br>
performing something very like a hornpipe on the roof of the
chaise.</p>

<p>Happily for me there is a limit to all human efforts, and even
<i>his</i> powers<br>
at length succumbed; so that, when we arrived at Bristol, I
persuaded him<br>
to go to bed, and I once more was left to the enjoyment of some
quiet. To<br>
fill up the few hours which intervened before bedtime, I strolled
into the<br>
coffee room. The English look of every one, and everything
around, had<br>
still its charm for me; and I contemplated, with no small
admiration, that<br>
air of neatness and propriety so observant from the bright-faced
clock that<br>
ticked unwearily upon the mantelpiece, to the trim waiter
himself, with<br>
noiseless step and a mixed look of vigilance and vacancy. The
perfect<br>
stillness struck me, save when a deep voice called for
"another<br>
brandy-and-water," and some more modestly-toned request would
utter a<br>
desire for "more cream." The attention of each man, absorbed in
the folds<br>
of his voluminous newspaper, scarcely deigning a glance at the
new-comer<br>
who entered, was in keeping with the general
surroundings,&mdash;giving, in<br>
their solemnity and gravity, a character of almost religious
seriousness,<br>
to what, in any other land, would be a scene of riotous and
discordant<br>
tumult. I was watching all this with a more than common interest,
when the<br>
door opened, and the waiter entered with a large placard. He was
followed<br>
by another with a ladder, by whose assistance he succeeded in
attaching the<br>
large square of paper to the wall above the fireplace. Every one
about rose<br>
up, curious to ascertain what was going forward; and I myself
joined in the<br>
crowd around the fire. The first glance of the announcement
showed me<br>
what it meant; and it was with a strange mixture of shame and
confusion I<br>
read:&mdash;</p>

<p>    "<i>Fall of Ciudad Rodrigo: with a full and detailed account
of the<br>
    storming of the great breach, capture of the enemy's cannon,
etc., by<br>
    Michael Free, 14th Light Dragoons</i>."</p>

<p>Leaving the many around me busied in conjecturing who the
aforesaid Mr.<br>
Free might be, and what peculiar opportunities he might have
enjoyed for<br>
his report, I hurried from the room and called the waiter.</p>

<p>"What's the meaning of the announcement you've just put up in
the<br>
coffee-room? Where did it come from?"</p>

<p>"Most important news, sir; exclusively in the columns of the
'<i>Bristol<br>
Telegraph</i>,'&mdash;the gentleman has just arrived&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Who, pray? What gentleman?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Free, sir, No. 13&mdash;large bed-room&mdash;blue damask&mdash;supper
for<br>
two&mdash;oysters&mdash;a devil&mdash;brandy-and-water-mulled port."</p>

<p>"What the devil do you mean? Is the fellow at supper?"</p>

<p>Somewhat shocked by the tone I ventured to assume towards the
illustrious<br>
narrator, the waiter merely bowed his reply.</p>

<p>"Show me to his room," said I; "I should like to see him."</p>

<p>"Follow me, if you please, sir,&mdash;this way. What name shall I
say, sir?"</p>

<p>"You need not mind announcing me,&mdash;I'm an old
acquaintance,&mdash;just show me<br>
the room."</p>

<p>"I beg pardon, sir, but Mr. Meekins, the editor of the
'<i>Telegraph</i>,' is<br>
engaged with him at present; and positive orders are given not to
suffer<br>
any interruption."</p>

<p>"No matter; do as I bid you. Is that it? Oh, I hear his voice.
There, that<br>
will do. You may go down-stairs, I'll introduce myself."</p>

<p>[CAPTAIN MICKEY FREE RELATING HIS HEROIC
DEEDS.]</p>
<br><br>

<p>So saying, and slipping a crown into the waiter's hand, I
proceeded<br>
cautiously towards the door, and opened it stealthily. My caution
was,<br>
however, needless; for a large screen was drawn across this part
of the<br>
room, completely concealing the door, closing which behind me, I
took my<br>
place beneath the shelter of this ambuscade, determined on no
account to be<br>
perceived by the parties.</p>

<p>Seated in a large arm-chair, a smoking tumbler of mulled port
before him,<br>
sat my friend Mike, dressed in my full regimentals, even to the
helmet,<br>
which, unfortunately however for the effect, he had put on back
foremost; a<br>
short "dudeen" graced his lip, and the trumpet so frequently
alluded to lay<br>
near him.</p>

<p>Opposite him sat a short, puny, round-faced little gentleman
with rolling<br>
eyes and a turned up nose. Numerous sheets of paper, pens, etc.,
lay<br>
scattered about; and he evinced, by his air and gesture, the most
marked<br>
and eager attention to Mr. Free's narrative, whose frequent
interruptions,<br>
caused by the drink and the oysters, were viewed with no small
impatience<br>
by the anxious editor.</p>

<p>"You must remember, Captain, time's passing; the placards are
all out. Must<br>
be at press before one o'clock to-night,&mdash;the morning edition is
everything<br>
with us. You were at the first parallel, I think."</p>

<p>"Devil a one o' me knows. Just ring that bell near you. Them's
elegant<br>
oysters; and you're not taking your drop of liquor. Here's a
toast for you:<br>
'May&mdash;' Whoop! raal Carlingford's, upon my conscience! See now,
if I won't<br>
hit the little black chap up there the first shot."</p>

<p>Scarcely were the words spoken, when a little painted bust of
Shakespeare<br>
fell in fragments on the floor, as an oyster-shell laid him
low.</p>

<p>A faint effort at a laugh at the eccentricities of his friend
was all the<br>
poor editor could accomplish, while Mike's triumph knew no
bounds.</p>

<p>"Didn't I tell you? But come now, are you ready? Give the pen
a drink, if<br>
you won't take one yourself."</p>

<p>"I am ready, quite ready," responded the editor.</p>

<p>"Faith, and it's more nor I am. See now, here it is: The night
was<br>
murthering dark; you could not see a stim."</p>

<p>"Not see a&mdash;a what?"</p>

<p>"A stim, bad luck to you; don't you know English? Hand me the
hot water.<br>
Have you that down yet?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Pray proceed."</p>

<p>"The Fifth Division was orthered up, bekase they were fighting
chaps; the<br>
Eighty-eighth was among them; the Rangers&mdash;Oh, upon my soul, we
must drink<br>
the Rangers! Here, devil a one o' me will go on till we give them
all the<br>
honors&mdash;Hip!&mdash;begin."</p>

<p>"Hip!" sighed the luckless editor, as he rose from his chair,
obedient to<br>
the command.</p>

<p>"Hurra! hurra! hurra! Well done! There's stuff in you yet,
ould foolscap!<br>
The little bottle's empty; ring again, if ye plaze.</p>

<p>    'Oh, Father Magan<br>
    Was a beautiful man,<br>
    But a bit of a rogue, a bit of a rogue!<br>
    He was just six feet high,<br>
    Had a cast in his eye,<br>
    And an illigint brogue, an illigint brogue!</p>

<p>    'He was born in Killarney,<br>
    And reared up in blarney&mdash;'</p>

<p>"Arrah, don't be looking miserable and dissolute that way.
Sure, I'm only<br>
screwing myself up for you; besides, you can print the song av
you like.<br>
It's a sweet tune, 'Teddy, you Gander,'"</p>

<p>"Really, Mr. Free, I see no prospect of our ever getting
done."</p>

<p>"The saints in Heaven forbid!" interrupted Mike, piously; "the
evening's<br>
young, and drink plenty. Here now, make ready!"</p>

<p>The editor once more made a gesture of preparation.</p>

<p>"Well, as I was saying," resumed Mike, "it was pitch dark when
the columns<br>
moved up, and a cold, raw night, with a little thin rain falling.
Have you<br>
that down?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Pray go on."</p>

<p>"Well, just as it might be here, at the corner of the trench,
I met Dr.<br>
Quill. 'They're waiting for you, Mr. Free,' says he, 'down there.
Picton's<br>
asking for you.' 'Faith, and he must wait,' says I, 'for I'm
terrible<br>
dry.' With that, he pulled out his canteen and mixed me a
little<br>
brandy-and-water. 'Are you taking it without a toast?' says
Doctor Maurice.<br>
'Never fear,' says I; 'here's Mary Brady&mdash;'"</p>

<p>"But, my dear sir," interposed Mr. Meekins, "pray <i>do</i>
remember this is<br>
somewhat irrelevant. In fifteen minutes it will be twelve
o'clock."</p>

<p>"I know it, ould boy, I know it. I see what you're at. You
were going to<br>
observe how much better we'd be for a broiled bone."</p>

<p>"Nothing of the kind, I assure you. For Heaven's sake, no more
eating and<br>
drinking!"</p>

<p>"No more eating nor drinking! Why not? You've a nice notion of
a convivial<br>
evening. Faith, we'll have the broiled bone sure enough, and,
what's more,<br>
a half gallon of the strongest punch they can make us; an' I hope
that,<br>
grave as you are, you'll favor the company with a song."</p>

<p>"Really, Mr. Free&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Arrah, none of your blarney! Don't be misthering me! Call me
Mickey, or<br>
Mickey Free, if you like better."</p>

<p>"I protest," said the editor, with dismay, "that here we are
two hours at<br>
work, and we haven't got to the foot of the great breach."</p>

<p>"And wasn't the army three months and a half in just getting
that far, with<br>
a battering train and mortars and the finest troops ever were
seen? And<br>
there you sit, a little fat creature, with your pen in your hand,
grumbling<br>
that you can't do more than the whole British army. Take care you
don't<br>
provoke me to beat you; for I am quiet till I'm roused. But, by
the Rock o'<br>
Cashel&mdash;"</p>

<p>Here he grasped the brass trumpet with an energy that made the
editor<br>
spring from his chair.</p>

<p>"For mercy's sake, Mr. Free&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, I won't; but sit down there, and don't be bothering me
about sieges<br>
and battles and things you know nothing about."</p>

<p>"I protest," rejoined Mr. Meekins, "that, had you not sent to
my office<br>
intimating your wish to communicate an account of the siege, I
never should<br>
have thought of intruding myself upon you. And now, since you
appear<br>
indisposed to afford the information in question, if you will
permit me,<br>
I'll wish you a very good-night."</p>

<p>"Faith, and so you shall, and help me to pass one too; for not
a step out<br>
o' that chair shall you take till morning. Do ye think I am going
to be<br>
left here by myself all alone?"</p>

<p>"I must observe&mdash;" said Mr. Meekins.</p>

<p>"To be sure, to be sure," said Mickey; "I see what you mean.
You're not the<br>
best of company, it's true; but at a pinch like this&mdash;There now,
take, your<br>
liquor."</p>

<p>"Once for all, sir," said the editor, "I would beg you to
recollect that,<br>
on the faith of your message to me, I have announced an account
of the<br>
storming of Ciudad Rodrigo for our morning edition. Are you
prepared, may I<br>
ask, for the consequences of my disappointing ten thousand
readers?"</p>

<p>"It's little I care for one of them. I never knew much of
reading myself."</p>

<p>"If you think to make a jest of me&mdash;" interposed Mr. Meekins,
reddening<br>
with passion.</p>

<p>"A jest of you! Troth, it's little fun I can get out of you;
you're as<br>
tiresome a creature as ever I spent an evening with. See now, I
told you<br>
before not to provoke me; we'll have a little more drink; ring
the bell.<br>
Who knows but you'll turn out better by-and-by?"</p>

<p>As Mike rose at these words to summon the waiter, Mr. Meekins
seized the<br>
opportunity to make his escape. Scarcely had he reached the door,
however,<br>
when he was perceived by Mickey, who hurled the trumpet at him
with all his<br>
force, while he uttered a shout that nearly left the poor editor
lifeless<br>
with terror. This time, happily, Mr. Free's aim failed him, and
before he<br>
could arrest the progress of his victim, he had gained the
corridor,<br>
and with one bound, cleared the first flight of the staircase,
his pace<br>
increasing every moment as Mike's denunciations grew louder and
louder,<br>
till at last, as he reached the street, Mr. Free's delight
overcame his<br>
indignation, and he threw himself upon a chair and laughed
immoderately.</p>

<p>"Oh, may I never! if I didn't frighten the editor. The little
spalpeen<br>
couldn't eat his oysters and take his punch like a man. But sure
if he<br>
didn't, there's more left for his betters." So saying, he filled
himself<br>
a goblet and drank it off. "Mr. Free, we won't say much for
your<br>
inclinations, for maybe they are not the best; but here's bad
luck to the<br>
fellow that doesn't think you good company; and here," added he,
again<br>
filling his glass,&mdash;"and here's may the devil take editors and
authors and<br>
compositors, that won't let us alone, but must be taking our
lives and our<br>
songs and our little devilments, that belongs to one's own
family, and tell<br>
them all over the world. A lazy set of thieves you are, every one
of you;<br>
spending your time inventing lies, devil a more nor less; and
here," this<br>
time he filled again,&mdash;"and here's a hot corner and Kilkenny
coals, that's<br>
half sulphur, to the villain&mdash;"</p>

<p>For what particular class of offenders Mike's penal code was
now devised, I<br>
was not destined to learn; for overcome by punch and indignation,
he gave<br>
one loud whoop, and measured his length upon the floor. Having
committed<br>
him to the care of the waiters, from whom I learned more fully
the<br>
particulars of his acquaintance with Mr. Meekins, I enjoined
them,<br>
strictly, not to mention that I knew anything of the matter; and
betook<br>
myself to my bed sincerely rejoicing that in a few hours more
Mike would<br>
be again in that laud where even his eccentricities and excesses
would be<br>
viewed with a favorable and forgiving eye.</p>

<br><br><br><br><p>CHAPTER XLI.</p>

<p>IRELAND.</p>

<p>"You'd better call your master up," said the skipper to Mickey
Free, on the<br>
second evening after our departure from Bristol; "he said he'd
like to have<br>
a look at the coast."</p>

<p>The words were overheard by me, as I lay between sleeping and
waking in the<br>
cabin of the packet, and without waiting for a second invitation,
I rushed<br>
upon deck. The sun was setting, and one vast surface of yellow
golden light<br>
played upon the water, as it rippled beneath a gentle gale. The
white foam<br>
curled at our prow, and the rushing sound told the speed we were
going at.<br>
The little craft was staggering under every sheet of her canvas,
and her<br>
spars creaked as her white sails bent before the breeze. Before
us, but to<br>
my landsman's eyes scarcely perceptible, were the ill-defined
outlines of<br>
cloudy darkness they called land, and which I continued to gaze
at with a<br>
strange sense of interest, while I heard the names of certain
well-known<br>
headlands assigned to apparently mere masses of fog-bank and
vapor.</p>

<p>He who has never been separated in early years, while yet the
budding<br>
affections of his heart are tender shoots, from the land of his
birth and<br>
of his home, knows nothing of the throng of sensations that crowd
upon him<br>
as he nears the shore of his country. The names, familiar as
household<br>
words, come with a train of long-buried thoughts; the feeling of
attachment<br>
to all we call our own&mdash;that patriotism of the heart&mdash;stirs
strongly within<br>
him, as the mingled thrills of hope and fear alternately move him
to joy or<br>
sadness.</p>

<p>Hard as are the worldly struggles between the daily cares of
him who carves<br>
out his own career and fortune, yet he has never experienced the
darkest<br>
poverty of fate who has not felt what it is to be a wanderer,
without a<br>
country to lay claim to. Of all the desolations that visit us,
this is the<br>
gloomiest and the worst. The outcast from the land of his
fathers, whose<br>
voice must never be heard within the walls where his infancy was
nurtured,<br>
nor his step be free upon the mountains where he gambolled in his
youth,<br>
this is indeed wretchedness. The instinct of country grows and
strengthens<br>
with our years; the joys of early life are linked with it; the
hopes of<br>
age point towards it; and he who knows not the thrill of ecstasy
some<br>
well-remembered, long-lost-sight-of place can bring to his heart
when<br>
returning after years of absence, is ignorant of one of the
purest sources<br>
of happiness of our nature.</p>

<p>With what a yearning of the heart, then, did I look upon the
dim and misty<br>
cliffs, that mighty framework of my island home, their stern
sides lashed<br>
by the blue waters of the ocean, and their summits lost within
the clouds!<br>
With what an easy and natural transition did my mind turn from
the wild<br>
mountains and the green valleys to their hardy sons, who toiled
beneath<br>
the burning sun of the Peninsula; and how, as some twinkling
light of the<br>
distant shore would catch my eye, did I wonder within myself
whether<br>
beside that hearth and board there might not sit some whose
thoughts<br>
were wandering over the sea beside the bold steeps of El Bodon,
or the<br>
death-strewn plain of Talavera,&mdash;their memories calling up some
trait of<br>
him who was the idol of his home; whose closing lids some fond
mother had<br>
watched over; above whose peaceful slumber her prayers had
fallen; but<br>
whose narrow bed was now beneath the breach of Badajos, and his
sleep the<br>
sleep that knows not waking!</p>

<p>I know not if in my sad and sorrowing spirit I did not envy
him who thus<br>
had met a soldier's fate,&mdash;for what of promise had my own! My
hopes of<br>
being in any way instrumental to my poor uncle's happiness grew
hourly<br>
less. His prejudices were deeply rooted and of long standing; to
have asked<br>
him to surrender any of what he looked upon as the prerogatives
of his<br>
house and name, would be to risk the loss of his esteem. What
then remained<br>
for me? Was I to watch, day by day and hour by hour, the falling
ruin of<br>
our fortunes? Was I to involve myself in the petty warfare of
unavailing<br>
resistance to the law? And could I stand aloof from my best, my
truest, my<br>
earliest friend, and see him, alone and unaided, oppose his weak
and final<br>
struggle to the unrelenting career of persecution. Between these
two<br>
alternatives the former could be my only choice; and what a
choice!</p>

<p>Oh, how I thought over the wild heroism of the battle-field,
the reckless<br>
fury of the charge, the crash, the death-cry, and the sad picture
of the<br>
morrow, when all was past, and a soldier's glory alone remained
to shed its<br>
high halo over the faults and the follies of the dead.</p>

<p>As night fell, the twinkling of the distant lighthouses&mdash;some
throwing<br>
a column of light from the very verge of the horizon, others
shining<br>
brightly, like stars, from some lofty promontory&mdash;marked the
different<br>
outlines of the coast, and conveyed to me the memory of that
broken and<br>
wild mountain tract that forms the bulwark of the Green Isle
against the<br>
waves of the Atlantic. Alone and silently I trod the deck, now
turning to<br>
look towards the shore, where I thought I could detect the
position of some<br>
well-known headland, now straining my eyes seaward to watch some
bright<br>
and flitting star, as it rose from or merged beneath the foaming
water,<br>
denoting the track of the swift pilot-boat, or the hardy lugger
of the<br>
fisherman; while the shrill whistle of the floating sea-gull was
the only<br>
sound save the rushing waves that broke in spray upon our
quarter.</p>

<p>What is it that so inevitably inspires sad and depressing
thoughts as we<br>
walk the deck of some little craft in the silence of the night's
dark<br>
hours? No sense of danger near, we hold on our course swiftly and
steadily,<br>
cleaving the dark waves and bending gracefully beneath the
freshening<br>
breeze. Yet still the motion, which, in the bright sunshine of
the noonday<br>
tells of joy and gladness, brings now no touch of pleasure to our
hearts.<br>
The dark and frowning sky, the boundless expanse of gloomy water,
spread<br>
like some gigantic pall around us, and our thoughts either turn
back upon<br>
the saddest features of the past or look forward to the future
with a<br>
sickly hope that all may not be as we fear it.</p>

<p>Mine were, indeed, of the gloomiest; and the selfishness alone
of the<br>
thought prevented me from wishing that, like many another, I had
fallen by<br>
a soldier's death on the plains of the Peninsula!</p>

<p>As the night wore on, I wrapped myself in my cloak and lay
down beneath the<br>
bulwark. The whole of my past life came in review before me, and
I thought<br>
over my first meeting with Lucy Dashwood; the thrill of boyish
admiration<br>
gliding into love; the hopes, the fears, that stirred my heart;
the firm<br>
resolve to merit her affection, which made me a soldier. Alas,
how little<br>
thought she of him to whose whole life she had been a guide-star
and a<br>
beacon! And as I thought over the hard-fought fields, the long,
fatiguing<br>
marches, the nights around the watch-fires, and felt how, in the
whirl<br>
and enthusiasm of a soldier's life, the cares and sorrows of
every day<br>
existence are forgotten, I shuddered to reflect upon the career
that might<br>
now open before me. To abandon, perhaps forever, the glorious
path I had<br>
been pursuing for a life of indolence and weariness, while my
name, that<br>
had already, by the chance of some fortunate circumstances, begun
to be<br>
mentioned with a testimony of approval, should be lost in
oblivion or<br>
remembered but as that of one whose early promise was not borne
out by the<br>
deeds of his manhood.</p>

<p>As day broke, overcome by watching, I slept, but was soon
awoke by the stir<br>
and bustle around me. The breeze had freshened, and we were
running under<br>
a reefed mainsail and foresail; and as the little craft bounded
above the<br>
blue water, the white foam crested above her prow, and ran in
boiling<br>
rivulets along towards the after-deck. The tramp of the seamen,
the hoarse<br>
voice of the captain, the shrill cry of the sea-birds, betokened,
however,<br>
nothing of dread or danger; and listlessly I leaned upon my elbow
and asked<br>
what was going forward.</p>

<p>"Nothing, sir; only making ready to drop our anchor."</p>

<p>"Are we so near shore, then?" said I.</p>

<p>"You've only to round that point to windward, and have a clear
run into<br>
Cork harbor."</p>

<p>I sprang at once to my legs. The land-fog prevented my seeing
anything<br>
whatever, but I thought that in the breeze, fresh and balmy as it
blew, I<br>
could feel the wind off shore. "At last," said I,&mdash;"at last!" as
I stepped<br>
into the little wherry which shot alongside of us, and we glided
into the<br>
still basin of Cove. How I remember every white-walled cottage,
and the<br>
beetling cliffs, and that bold headland beside which the valley
opens, with<br>
its dark-green woods, and then Spike Island. And what a stir is
yonder,<br>
early as it is; the men-of-war tenders seem alive with people,
while still<br>
the little village is sunk in slumber, not a smoke-wreath rising
from its<br>
silent hearths. Every plash of the oars in the calm water as I
neared the<br>
land, every chance word of the bronzed and hardy fisherman, told
upon my<br>
heart. I felt it was my home.</p>

<p>"Isn't it beautiful, sir? Isn't it illigant?" said a voice
behind me, which<br>
there could be little doubt in my detecting, although I had not
seen the<br>
individual since I left England.</p>

<p>"Is not what beautiful?" replied I, rather harshly, at the
interruption of<br>
my own thoughts.</p>

<p>"Ireland, to be sure; and long life to her!" cried he, with a
cheer that<br>
soon found its responsive echoes in the hearts of our sailors,
who seconded<br>
the sentiment with all their energy.</p>

<p>"How am I to get up to Cork, lads?" said I. "I am pressed for
time, and<br>
must get forward."</p>

<p>"We'll row your honor the whole way, av it's plazing to
you."</p>

<p>"Why, thank you, I'd rather find some quicker mode of
proceeding."</p>

<p>"Maybe you'd have a chaise? There's an elegant one at
M'Cassidy's."</p>

<p>"Sure, the blind mare's in foal," said the bow oar. "The devil
a step she<br>
can go out of a walk; so, your honor, take Tim Riley's car, and
you'll get<br>
up cheap. Not that you care for money; but he's going up at eight
o'clock<br>
with two young ladies."</p>

<p>"Oh, be-gorra!" said the other, "and so he is. And faix, ye
might do worse;<br>
they're nice craytures."</p>

<p>"Well," said I, "your advice seems good; but perhaps they
might object to<br>
my company."</p>

<p>"I've no fear; they're always with the officers. Sure, the
Miss<br>
Dalrymples&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The Miss Dalrymples! Push ahead, boys; it must be later than
I thought. We<br>
must get the chaise; I can't wait."</p>

<p>Ten minutes more brought us to land.</p>

<p>My arrangements were soon made, and as my impatience to press
forward<br>
became greater the nearer I drew to my destination, I lost not a
moment.</p>

<p>The yellow chaise&mdash;sole glory of Cove&mdash;was brought forth at my
request; and<br>
by good fortune, four posters which had been down the preceding
evening<br>
from Cork to some gentleman's seat near were about to return.
These were<br>
also pressed into my service; and just as the first early riser
of the<br>
little village was drawing his curtain to take a half-closed
eye-glance<br>
upon the breaking morning, I rattled forth upon my journey at a
pace which,<br>
could I only have secured its continuance, must soon have
terminated my<br>
weary way.</p>

<p>Beautiful as the whole line of country is, I was totally
unconscious of it;<br>
and even Mike's conversational powers, divided as they were
between myself<br>
and the two postilions, were fruitless in arousing me from the
deep<br>
pre-occupation of my mind by thoughts of home.</p>

<p>It was, then, with some astonishment I heard the boy upon the
wheeler ask<br>
whither he should drive me to.</p>

<p>"Tell his honor to wake up; we're in Cork now."</p>

<p>"In Cork! Impossible, already!"</p>

<p>"Faith, may be so; but it's Cork, sure enough."</p>

<p>"Drive to the 'George.' It's not far from the
commander-in-chief's<br>
quarters."</p>

<p>"'Tis five minutes' walk, sir. You'll be there before they're
put to<br>
again."</p>

<p>"Horses for Fermoy!" shouted out the postilions, as we tore up
to the door<br>
in a gallop. I sprang out, and by the assistance of the waiter,
discovered<br>
Sir Henry Howard's quarters, to whom my despatches were
addressed. Having<br>
delivered them into the hands of an aide-de-camp, who sat bolt
upright in<br>
his bed, rubbing his eyes to appear awake, I again hurried
down-stairs, and<br>
throwing myself into the chaise, continued my journey.</p>

<p>"Them's beautiful streets, any how!" said Mike, "av they
wasn't kept so<br>
dirty, and the houses so dark, and the pavement bad. That's Mr.
Beamish's,<br>
that fine house there with the brass rapper and the green lamp
beside it;<br>
and there's the hospital. Faix, and there's the place we beat the
police<br>
when I was here before; and the house with the sign of the
Highlander is<br>
thrown down; and what's the big building with the stone posts at
the door?"</p>

<p>"The bank, sir," said the postilion, with a most deferential
air as Mike<br>
addressed him. "What bank, acushla?"</p>

<p>"Not a one of me knows, sir; but they call it the bank, though
it's only an<br>
empty house."</p>

<p>"Cary and Moore's bank, perhaps?" said I, having heard that in
days long<br>
past some such names had failed in Cork for a large amount.</p>

<p>"So it is; your honor's right," cried the postilion; while
Mike, standing<br>
up on the box, and menacing the house with his clinched fist,
shouted out<br>
at the very top of his voice:</p>

<p>"Oh, bad luck to your cobwebbed windows and iron railings!
Sure, it's my<br>
father's son ought to hate the sight of you."</p>

<p>"I hope, Mike, your father never trusted his property in such
hands?"</p>

<p>"I don't suspect he did, your honor. He never put much belief
in the banks;<br>
but the house cost him dear enough without that."</p>

<p>As I could not help feeling some curiosity in this matter, I
pressed Mickey<br>
for an explanation.</p>

<p>"But maybe it's not Cary and Moore's, after all; and I may be
cursing<br>
dacent people."</p>

<p>Having reassured his mind by telling him that the reservation
he made by<br>
the doubt would tell in their favor should he prove mistaken, he
afforded<br>
me the following information:&mdash;</p>

<p>"When my father&mdash;the heavens be his bed!&mdash;was in the 'Cork,'
they put him<br>
one night on guard at that same big house you just passed, av it
was the<br>
same; but if it wasn't that, it was another. And it was a
beautiful fine<br>
night in August and the moon up, and plenty of people walking
about,<br>
and all kinds of fun and devilment going on,&mdash;drinking and
dancing and<br>
everything.</p>

<p>"Well, my father was stuck up there with his musket, to walk
up and down,<br>
and not say, 'God save you kindly,' or the time of day or
anything, but<br>
just march as if he was in the barrack-yard; and by reason of his
being the<br>
man he was he didn't like it half, but kept cursing and swearing
to himself<br>
like mad when he saw pleasant fellows and pretty girls going by,
laughing<br>
and joking.</p>

<p>"'Good-evening, Mickey,' says one. 'Fine sport ye have all to
yourself,<br>
with your long feather in your cap.'</p>

<p>"'Arrah, look how proud he is,' says another, 'with his head
up as if he<br>
didn't see a body.'</p>

<p>"'Shoulder, hoo!' cried a drunken chap, with a shovel in his
hand. Then<br>
they all began laughing away at my father.</p>

<p>"'Let the dacent man alone,' said an ould fellow in a wig.
'Isn't he<br>
guarding the bank, wid all the money in it?'</p>

<p>"'Faix, he isn't,' says another; 'for there's none left.'</p>

<p>"'What's that you're saying?' says my father.</p>

<p>"'Just that the bank's broke; devil a more!' says he.</p>

<p>"'And there's no goold in it?' says my father.</p>

<p>'"Divil a guinea.'</p>

<p>"'Nor silver?'</p>

<p>"'No, nor silver; nor as much as sixpence, either.'</p>

<p>"'Didn't ye hear that all day yesterday when the people was
coming in with<br>
their notes, the chaps there were heating the guineas in a
frying-pan,<br>
pretending that they were making them as fast as they could; and
sure, when<br>
they had a batch red-hot they spread them out to cool; and what
betune the<br>
hating and the cooling, and the burning the fingers counting
them, they<br>
kept the bank open to three o'clock, and then they ran away.'</p>

<p>"'Is it truth yer telling?' says my father.</p>

<p>"'Sorra word o' lie in it! Myself had two-and-fourpence of
their notes.'</p>

<p>"'And so they're broke,' says my father, 'and nothing
left?'</p>

<p>"'Not a brass farden.'</p>

<p>"'And what am I staying here for, I wonder, if there's nothing
to guard?'</p>

<p>"'Faix, if it isn't for the pride of the thing&mdash;'</p>

<p>"'Oh, sorra taste!'</p>

<p>"'Well, may be for divarsion.'</p>

<p>"'Nor that either.'</p>

<p>"'Faix, then you're a droll man, to spend the evening that
way,' says he;<br>
and all the crowd&mdash;for there was a crowd&mdash;said the same. So with
that my<br>
father unscrewed his bayonet, and put his piece on his shoulder,
and walked<br>
off to his bed in the barrack as peaceable as need be. But well,
when they<br>
came to relieve him, wasn't there a raal commotion? And faith,
you see, it<br>
went mighty hard with my father the next morning; for the bank
was open<br>
just as usual, and my father was sintinced to fifty lashes, but
got<br>
off with a week in prison, and three more rowling a big stone in
the<br>
barrack-yard."</p>

<p>Thus chatting away, the time passed over, until we arrived at
Fermoy.<br>
Here there was some little delay in procuring horses; and during
the<br>
negotiation, Mike, who usually made himself master of the
circumstances of<br>
every place through which he passed, discovered that the grocer's
shop of<br>
the village was kept by a namesake, and possibly a relation of
his own.</p>

<p>"I always had a notion, Mister Charles, that I came from a
good stock; and<br>
sure enough, here's 'Mary Free' over the door there, and a
beautiful place<br>
inside; full of tay and sugar and gingerbread and glue and coffee
and bran,<br>
pickled herrings, soap, and many other commodities."</p>

<p>"Perhaps you'd like to claim kindred, Mike," said I,
interrupting; "I'm<br>
sure she'd feel flattered to discover a relative in a Peninsular
hero."</p>

<p>"It's just what I'm thinking; av we were going to pass the
evening here,<br>
I'd try if I couldn't make her out a second cousin at least."</p>

<p>Fortune, upon this occasion, seconded Mike's wishes, for when
the horses<br>
made their appearance, I learned, to my surprise, that the near
side one<br>
would not bear a saddle, and the off-sider could only run on his
own<br>
side. In this conjuncture, the postilion was obliged to drive
from what,<br>
<i>Hibernic&egrave;</i> speaking, is called the perch,&mdash;no ill-applied
denomination to<br>
a piece of wood which, about the thickness of one's arm, is hung
between<br>
the two fore-springs, and serves as a resting-place in which the
luckless<br>
wight, weary of the saddle, is not sorry to repose himself.</p>

<p>"What's to be done?" cried I. "There's no room within; my
traps barely<br>
leave space for myself among them."</p>

<p>"Sure, sir," said the postilion, "the other gentleman can
follow in the<br>
morning coach; and if any accident happens to yourself on the
road, by<br>
reason of a break-down, he'll be there as soon as yourself."</p>

<p>This, at least, was an agreeable suggestion, and as I saw it
chimed with<br>
Mike's notions, I acceded at once; he came running up at the
moment.</p>

<p>"I had a peep at her through the window, Mister Charles, and,
faix, she has<br>
a great look of the family."</p>

<p>"Well, Mickey, I'll leave you twenty-four hours to cultivate
the<br>
acquaintance; and to a man like you the time, I know, is ample.
Follow me<br>
by the morning's coach. Till then, good-by."</p>

<p>Away we rattled once more, and soon left the town behind us.
The wild<br>
mountain tract which stretched on either side of the road
presented one<br>
bleak and brown surface, unrelieved by any trace of tillage or
habitation;<br>
an apparently endless succession of fern-clad hills lay on every
side;<br>
above, the gloomy sky of leaden, lowering aspect, frowned darkly;
the sad<br>
and wailing cry of the pewet or the plover was the only sound
that broke<br>
the stillness, and far as the eye could reach, a dreary waste
extended.<br>
The air, too, was cold and chilly; it was one of those days
which, in our<br>
springs, seemed to cast a retrospective glance towards the winter
they have<br>
left behind them. The prospect was no cheering one; from heaven
above or<br>
earth below there came no sight nor sound of gladness. The rich
glow of the<br>
Peninsular landscape was still fresh in my memory,&mdash;the luxurious
verdure;<br>
the olive, the citron, and the vine; the fair valleys teeming
with<br>
abundance; the mountains terraced with their vineyards; the
blue<br>
transparent sky spreading o'er all; while the very air was rife
with the<br>
cheering song of birds that peopled every grove. What a contrast
was here!<br>
We travelled on for miles, but no village nor one human face did
we see.<br>
Far in the distance a thin wreath of smoke curled upward; but it
came from<br>
no hearth; it arose from one of those field-fires by which
spendthrift<br>
husbandry cultivates the ground. It was, indeed, sad; and yet, I
know not<br>
how, it spoke more home to my heart than all the brilliant
display and all<br>
the voluptuous splendor I had witnessed in London. By degrees
some traces<br>
of wood made their appearance, and as we descended the mountain
towards<br>
Cahir, the country assumed a more cultivated and cheerful
look,&mdash;patches of<br>
corn or of meadow-land stretched on either side, and the voice of
children<br>
and the lowing of oxen mingled with the cawing of the rooks, as
in dense<br>
clouds they followed the ploughman's track. The changed features
of the<br>
prospect resembled the alternate phases of temperament of the
dweller on<br>
the soil,&mdash;the gloomy determination; the smiling carelessness;
the dark<br>
spirit of boding; the reckless jollity; the almost savage
ferocity of<br>
purpose, followed by a child-like docility and a womanly
softness; the<br>
grave, the gay, the resolute, the fickle; the firm, the yielding,
the<br>
unsparing, and the tender-hearted,&mdash;blending their contrarieties
into one<br>
nature, of whose capabilities one cannot predicate the bounds,
but to whom,<br>
by some luckless fatality of fortune, the great rewards of life
have been<br>
generally withheld until one begins to feel that the curse of
Swift was<br>
less the sarcasm wrung from indignant failures than the cold and
stern<br>
prophecy of the moralist.</p>

<p>But how have I fallen into this strain! Let me rather turn my
eyes forward<br>
towards my home. How shall I find all there? Have his altered
fortunes<br>
damped the warm ardor of my poor uncle's heart? Is his smile
sicklied over<br>
by sorrow; or shall I hear his merry laugh and his cheerful voice
as in<br>
days of yore? How I longed to take my place beside that hearth,
and in the<br>
same oak-chair where I have sat telling the bold adventures of a
fox-chase<br>
or some long day upon the moors, speak of the scenes of my
campaigning<br>
life, and make known to him those gallant fellows by whose side I
have<br>
charged in battle, or sat in the bivouac! How will he glory in
the<br>
soldier-like spirit and daring energy of Fred Power! How will he
chuckle<br>
over the blundering earnestness and Irish warmth of
O'Shaughnessy! How will<br>
he laugh at the quaint stories and quainter jests of Maurice
Quill! And how<br>
often will he wish once more to be young in hand as in heart to
mingle with<br>
such gay fellows, with no other care, no other sorrow, to depress
him, save<br>
the passing fortune of a soldier's life!</p>

<br><br><br><br><p>CHAPTER XLII.</p>

<p>THE RETURN.</p>

<p>A rude shock awoke me as I lay asleep in the corner of the
chaise; a shout<br>
followed, and the next moment the door was torn open, and I heard
the<br>
postilion's voice crying to me:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Spring out! Jump out quickly, sir!"</p>

<p>A whole battery of kicks upon the front panel drowned the rest
of his<br>
speech; but before I could obey his injunction, he was pitched
upon the<br>
road, the chaise rolled over and the pole snapped short in the
middle,<br>
while the two horses belabored the carriage and each other with
all their<br>
might. Managing, as well as I was able, to extricate myself, I
leaped out<br>
upon the road, and by the aid of a knife, and at the cost of some
bruises,<br>
succeeded in freeing the horses from their tackle. The postboy,
who had<br>
escaped without any serious injury, labored manfully to aid me,
blubbering<br>
the whole time upon the consequences his misfortune would bring
down upon<br>
his head.</p>

<p>"Bad luck to ye!" cried he, apostrophizing the off-horse, a
tall, raw-boned<br>
beast, with a Roman nose, a dipped back, and a tail ragged and
jagged like<br>
a hand-saw,&mdash;"bad luck to ye! there never was a good one of your
color!"</p>

<p>This, for the information of the "unjockeyed," I may add, was
a species of<br>
brindled gray.</p>

<p>"How did it happen, Patsey; how did it happen, my lad?"</p>

<p>"It was the heap o' stones they left in the road since last
autumn; and<br>
though I riz him at it fairly, he dragged the ould mare over it
and broke<br>
the pole. Oh, wirra, wirra!" cried he, wringing his hands in an
agony of<br>
grief, "sure there's neither luck nor grace to be had with ye
since the day<br>
ye drew the judge down to the last assizes!"</p>

<p>"Well, what's to be done?"</p>

<p>"Sorra a bit o' me knows; the shay's ruined intirely, and the
ould divil<br>
there knows he's conquered us. Look at him there, listening to
every word<br>
we're saying! You eternal thief, may be its ploughing you'd like
better!"</p>

<p>"Come, come," said I, "this will never get us forward. What
part of the<br>
country are we in?"</p>

<p>"We left Banagher about four miles behind us; that's Killimur
you see with<br>
the smoke there in the hollow."</p>

<p>Now, although I did not see Killimur (for the gray mist of the
morning<br>
prevented me recognizing any object a few hundred yards distant),
yet from<br>
the direction in which he pointed, and from the course of the
Shannon,<br>
which I could trace indistinctly, I obtained a pretty accurate
notion of<br>
where we were.</p>

<p>"Then we are not very far from Portumna?"</p>

<p>"Just a pleasant walk before your breakfast."</p>

<p>"And is there not a short cut to O'Malley Castle over that
mountain?"</p>

<p>"Faix, and so there is; and ye can be no stranger to these
parts if ye know<br>
that."</p>

<p>"I have travelled it before now. Just tell me, is the wooden
bridge<br>
standing over the little stream? It used to be carried away every
winter in<br>
my time."</p>

<p>"It's just the same now. You'll have to pass by the upper
ford; but it<br>
comes to the same, for that will bring you to the back gate of
the demesne,<br>
and one way is just as short as the other."</p>

<p>"I know it, I know it; so now, do you follow me with my
luggage to the<br>
castle, and I'll set out on foot."</p>

<p>So saying, I threw off my cloak, and prepared myself for a
sharp walk of<br>
some eight miles over the mountain. As I reached the little knoll
of land<br>
which, overlooking the Shannon, affords a view of several miles
in every<br>
direction, I stopped to gaze upon the scene where every object
around was<br>
familiar to me from infancy: the broad, majestic river, sweeping
in bold<br>
curves between the wild mountains of Connaught and the wooded
hills and<br>
cultivated slopes of the more fertile Munster, the tall chimneys
of many a<br>
house rose above the dense woods where in my boyhood I had spent
hours and<br>
days of happiness. One last look I turned towards the scene of my
late<br>
catastrophe ere I began to descend the mountain. The postboy,
with the<br>
happy fatalism of his country, and a firm trust in the future,
had<br>
established himself in the interior of the chaise, from which a
blue curl<br>
of smoke wreathed upward from his pipe; the horses grazed
contentedly by<br>
the roadside; and were I to judge from the evidence before me, I
should say<br>
that I was the only member of the party inconvenienced by the
accident. A<br>
thin sleeting of rain began to fall; the wind blew sharply in my
face, and<br>
the dark clouds, collecting in masses above, seemed to threaten a
storm.<br>
Without stopping for even a passing look at the many well-known
spots<br>
about, I pressed rapidly on. My old experience upon the moors had
taught<br>
me that sling trot in which jumping from hillock to hillock over
the<br>
boggy surface, you succeed in accomplishing your journey not only
with<br>
considerable speed, but perfectly dryshod.</p>

<p>By the lonely path which I travelled, it was unlikely I should
meet any<br>
one. It was rarely traversed except by the foot of the sportsman,
or some<br>
stray messenger from the castle to the town of Banagher. Its
solitude,<br>
however, was in no wise distasteful to me; my heart was full to
bursting.<br>
Each moment as I walked some new feature of my home presented
itself<br>
before me. Now it was all happiness and comfort; the scene of its
ancient<br>
hospitable board, its warm hearth, its happy faces, and its ready
welcome<br>
were all before me, and I increased my speed to the utmost, when
suddenly a<br>
sense of sad and sorrowing foreboding would draw around me, and
the image<br>
of my uncle's sick-bed, his worn features, his pallid look, his
broken<br>
voice would strike upon my heart, and all the changes that
poverty,<br>
desertion, and decay can bring to pass would fall upon my heart,
and weak<br>
and trembling I would stand for some moments unable to
proceed.</p>

<p>Oh, how many a reproachful thought came home to me at what I
scrupled<br>
not to call to myself the desertion of my home! Oh, how many a
prayer I<br>
uttered, in all the fervor of devotion, that my selfish
waywardness and<br>
my yearning for ambition might not bring upon me, in after-life,
years<br>
of unavailing regret! As I thought thus, I reached the brow of a
little<br>
mountain ridge, beneath which, at a distance of scarcely more
than a mile,<br>
the dark woods of O'Malley Castle stretched, before me. The house
itself<br>
was not visible, for it was situated in a valley beside the
river. But<br>
there lay the whole scene of my boyhood: there the little creek
where my<br>
boat was kept, and where I landed on the morning after my duel
with Bodkin;<br>
there stretched for many a mile the large, callow meadows, where
I trained<br>
my horses, and schooled them for the coming season; and far in
the<br>
distance, the brown and rugged peak of old Scariff was lost in
the clouds.<br>
The rain by this time had ceased, the wind had fallen, and an
almost<br>
unnatural stillness prevailed around; but yet the heavy masses of
vapor<br>
frowned ominously, and the leaden hue of land and water wore a
gloomy and<br>
depressing aspect. My impatience to get on increased every
moment, and<br>
descending the mountain at the top of my speed, I at length
reached the<br>
little oak paling that skirted the wood, opened the little
wicket, and<br>
entered the path. It was the self-same one I had trod in revery
and<br>
meditation the night before I left my home. I remember, too,
sitting down<br>
beside the little well which, enclosed in a frame of rock, ran
trickling<br>
across the path to be lost among the gnarled roots and fallen
leaves<br>
around. Yes, this was the very spot.</p>

<p>Overcome for the instant by my exertion and by my emotion, I
sat down upon<br>
the stone, and taking off my cap, bathed my heated and throbbing
temples in<br>
the cold spring, Refreshed at once, I was about to rise and press
onward,<br>
when suddenly my attention was caught by a sound which, faint
from<br>
distance, scarce struck upon my ear. I listened again; but all
was still<br>
and silent, the dull splash of the river as it broke upon the
reedy shore<br>
was the only sound I heard. Thinking it probably some mere
delusion of my<br>
heated imagination, I rose to push forward; but at the moment a
slight<br>
breeze stirred in the leaves around me, the light branches
rustled and bent<br>
beneath it, and a low moaning sound swelled upward, increasing
each instant<br>
as it came; like the distant roar of some mighty torrent it grew
louder as<br>
the wind bore it towards me, and now falling, now swelling, it
burst<br>
forth into one loud, prolonged cry of agony and grief. O God! it
was the<br>
death-wail! I fell upon my knees, my hands clasped in agony; the
sweat<br>
of misery dropped off my brow, and with a heart bleeding and
breaking I<br>
prayed&mdash;I know not what. Again the terrible cry smote upon my
ear, and I<br>
could mark the horrible cadences of the death-song, as the voices
of the<br>
mourners joined in chorus.</p>

<p>My suspense became too great to bear. I dashed madly forward,
one sound<br>
still ringing in my ears, one horrid image before my eyes. I
reached the<br>
garden wall; I cleared the little rivulet beside the
flower-garden; I<br>
traversed its beds (neglected and decayed); I gained the avenue,
taking<br>
no heed of the crowds before me,&mdash;some on foot, some on
horseback, others<br>
mounted upon the low country car, many seated in groups upon the
grass,<br>
their heads bowed upon their bosoms, silent and speechless. As I
neared the<br>
house the whole approach was crowded with carriages and horsemen.
At the<br>
foot of the large flight of steps stood the black and mournful
hearse,<br>
its plumes nodding in the breeze. With the speed of madness and
the<br>
recklessness of despair I tore my way through the thickly
standing groups<br>
upon the steps; I could not speak, I could not utter. Once more
the<br>
frightful cry swelled upward, and in its wild notes seemed to
paralyze me;<br>
for with my hands upon my temples, I stood motionless and still.
A heavy<br>
footfall as of persons marching in procession came nearer and
nearer, and<br>
as the sounds without sank into sobs of bitterness and woe, the
black pall<br>
of a coffin, borne on men's shoulders, appeared at the door, and
an old man<br>
whose gray hair floated in the breeze, and across whose stern
features a<br>
struggle for self-mastery&mdash;a kind of spasmodic effort&mdash;was
playing, held<br>
out his hand to enforce silence. His eye, lack-lustre and dimmed
with age,<br>
roved over the assembled multitude, but there was no recognition
in his<br>
look until at last he turned it on me. A slight hectic flush
colored his<br>
pale cheek, his lip trembled, he essayed to speak, but could not.
I sprang<br>
towards him, but choked by agony, I could not utter; my look,
however,<br>
spoke what my tongue could not. He threw his arms around me, and
muttering<br>
the words, "Poor Godfrey!" pointed to the coffin.</p>

<br><br><br><br><p>CHAPTER XLIII.</p>

<p>HOME.</p>

<p>Many, many years have passed away since the time I am now
about to speak<br>
of, and yet I cannot revert, even for a moment, to the period
without a sad<br>
and depressing feeling at my heart. The wreck of fortune, the
thwarting of<br>
ambition, the failure in enterprise, great though they be, are
endurable<br>
evils. The never-dying hope that youth is blessed with will find
its<br>
resting-place still within the breast, and the baffled and beaten
will<br>
struggle on unconquered; but for the death of friends, for the
loss of<br>
those in whom our dearest affections were centred, there is no
solace,&mdash;the<br>
terrible "never" of the grave knows no remorse, and even memory,
that in<br>
our saddest hours can bring bright images and smiling faces
before us,<br>
calls up here only the departed shade of happiness, a passing
look at that<br>
Eden of our joys from which we are separated forever. And the
desolation of<br>
the heart is never perfect till it has felt the echoes of a last
farewell<br>
on earth reverberating within it.</p>

<p>Oh, with what tortures of self-reproach we think of all former
intercourse<br>
with him that is gone! How would we wish to live our lives once
more,<br>
correcting each passage of unkindness or neglect! How deeply do
we blame<br>
ourselves for occasions of benefit lost, and opportunities
unprofited by;<br>
and how unceasingly, through after-life, the memory of the
departed recurs<br>
to us! In all the ties which affection and kindred weave around
us, one<br>
vacant spot is there, unseen and unknown by others, which no
blandishments<br>
of love, no caresses of friendship can fill up; although the rank
grass<br>
and the tall weeds of the churchyard may close around the humble
tomb,<br>
the cemetery of the heart is holy and sacred, pure from all the
troubled<br>
thoughts and daily cares of the busy world. To that hallowed spot
do we<br>
retire as into our chamber, and when unrewarded efforts bring
discomfiture<br>
and misery to our minds, when friends are false, and cherished
hopes are<br>
blasted, we think on those who never ceased to love till they had
ceased to<br>
live; and in the lonely solitude of our affliction we call upon
those who<br>
hear not, and may never return.</p>

<p>Mine was a desolate hearth. I sat moodily down in the old oak
parlor, my<br>
heart bowed down with grief. The noiseless steps, the mourning
garments of<br>
the old servants; the unnatural silence of those walls within
which from<br>
my infancy the sounds of merriment and mirth had been familiar;
the large<br>
old-fashioned chair where he was wont to sit, now placed against
the<br>
wall,&mdash;all spoke of the sad past. Yet, when some footsteps would
draw near,<br>
and the door would open, I could not repress a thrill of hope
that he was<br>
coming; more than once I rushed to the window and looked out; I
could have<br>
sworn I heard his voice.</p>

<p>The old cob pony he used to ride was grazing peacefully before
the door;<br>
poor Carlo, his favorite spaniel, lay stretched upon the terrace,
turning<br>
ever and anon a look towards the window, and then, as if wearied
of<br>
watching for him who came not, he would utter a long, low,
wailing cry, and<br>
lie down again to sleep. The rich lawn, decked with field flowers
of many<br>
a hue, stretched away towards the river, upon whose calm surface
the<br>
white-sailed lugger scarce seemed to move; the sounds of a
well-known Irish<br>
air came, softened by distance, as some poor fisherman sat
mending his net<br>
upon the bank, and the laugh of children floated on the breeze.
Yes, they<br>
were happy.</p>

<p>Two months had elapsed since my return home; how passed by me
I know not; a<br>
lethargic stupor had settled upon me. Whole days long I sat at
the window,<br>
looking listlessly at the tranquil river, and watching the white
foam as,<br>
borne down from the rapids, it floated lazily along. The count
had left me<br>
soon, being called up to Dublin by some business, and I was
utterly alone.<br>
The different families about called frequently to ask after me,
and would,<br>
doubtless, have done all in their power to alleviate my sorrow,
and lighten<br>
the load of my affliction; but with a morbid fear, I avoided
every one, and<br>
rarely left the house except at night-fall, and then only to
stroll by some<br>
lonely and deserted path.</p>

<p>Life had lost its charm for me; my gratified ambition had
ended in the<br>
blackest disappointment, and all for which I had labored and
longed was<br>
only attained that I might feel it valueless.</p>

<p>Of my circumstances as to fortune I knew nothing, and cared
not more;<br>
poverty and riches could matter little now; all my day dreams
were<br>
dissipated now, and I only waited for Considine's return to leave
Ireland<br>
forever. I had made up my mind, if by any unexpected turn of fate
the war<br>
should cease in the Peninsula, to exchange into an Indian
regiment. The<br>
daily association with objects which recalled but one image to my
brain,<br>
and that ever accompanied by remorse of conscience, gave me not a
moment's<br>
peace. My every thought of happiness was mixed up with scenes
which now<br>
presented nothing but the evidences of blighted hope; to remain,
then,<br>
where I was, would be to sink into the heartless misanthropist,
and I<br>
resolved that with my sword I would carve out a soldier's fortune
and a<br>
soldier's grave.</p>

<p>Considine came at last. I was sitting alone, at my usual post
beside the<br>
window, when the chaise rattled up to the door; for an instant I
started to<br>
my legs; a vague sense of something like hope shot through me,
the whole<br>
might be a dream, and <i>he</i>&mdash;The next moment I became cold and
sick, a<br>
faintish giddiness obscured my sight, and though I felt his grasp
as he<br>
took my hand, I saw him not. An indistinct impression still
dwells upon my<br>
mind of his chiding me for my weakness in thus giving way; of his
calling<br>
upon me to assert my position, and discharge the duties of him
whose<br>
successor I now was. I heard him in silence; and when he
concluded, faintly<br>
pledging myself to obey him, I hurried to my room, and throwing
myself upon<br>
my bed burst into an agony of tears. Hitherto my pent up sorrow
had wasted<br>
me day by day; but the rock was now smote, and in that gush of
misery my<br>
heart found relief.</p>

<p>When I appeared the following morning, the count was struck
with my altered<br>
looks; a settled sorrow could not conceal the changes which time
and<br>
manhood had made upon me; and as from a kind of fear of showing
how deeply<br>
I grieved, I endeavored to conceal it, by degrees I was enabled
to converse<br>
calmly and dispassionately upon my fortunes.</p>

<p>"Poor Godfrey," said he, "appointed me his sole executor a few
days before<br>
it happened; he knew the time was drawing near, and strange
enough,<br>
Charley, though he heard of your return to England, he would not
let us<br>
write. The papers spoke of you as being at Carlton House almost
daily; your<br>
name appeared at every great festival; and while his heart warmed
at your<br>
brilliant success, he absolutely dreaded your coming home.
'Poor<br>
fellow,' he would say, 'what a change for him, to leave the
splendor<br>
and magnificence of his Prince's board for our meagre fare and
altered<br>
fortunes! And then,' he added, 'as for me&mdash;God forgive me!&mdash;I can
go now;<br>
but how should I bear to part with him if he comes back to me.'
And now,"<br>
said the count, when he had concluded a detailed history of my
dear uncle's<br>
last illness,&mdash;"and now, Charley, what are your plans?"</p>

<p>Briefly, and in a few words, I stated to him my intentions.
Without placing<br>
much stress upon the strongest of my reasons&mdash;my distaste to what
had once<br>
been home&mdash;I avowed my wish to join my regiment at once.</p>

<p>He heard me with evident impatience, and as I finished, seized
my arm<br>
in his strong grasp. "No, no, boy, none of this; your tone of
assumed<br>
composure cannot impose on Bill Considine. You must not return to
the<br>
Peninsula&mdash;at least not yet awhile; the disgust of life may be
strong at<br>
twenty, but it's not lasting; besides, Charley," here his voice
faltered<br>
slightly, "<i>his</i> wishes you'll not treat lightly. Read this."</p>

<p>As he spoke, he took a blotted and ill-written letter from
his<br>
breast-pocket, and handed it to me. It was in my poor uncle's
hand, and<br>
dated the very morning of his death. It ran thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>    Dear Bill,&mdash;Charley must never part with the old
house,<br>
    come what will; I leave too many ties behind for a stranger's
heritage;<br>
    he must live among my old friends, and watch, protect<br>
    and comfort them. He has done enough for fame; let him
now<br>
    do something for affection. We have none of us been over
good<br>
    to these poor people; one of the name must try and save
our<br>
    credit. God bless you both! It is, perhaps, the last time I
shall<br>
    utter it.</p>

<p>    G. O'M.</p>

<p>I read these few and, to me, affecting lines over and over,
forgetful of<br>
all save of him who penned them; when Considine, who supposed
that my<br>
silence was attributable to doubt and hesitation, called
out:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Well, what now?"</p>

<p>"I remain," said I, briefly.</p>

<p>He seized me in his arms with transport, as he said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I knew it, boy, I knew it. They told me you were spoiled by
flattery, and<br>
your head turned by fortune; they said that home and country
would weigh<br>
lightly in the balance against fame and glory; but I said no, I
knew you<br>
better. I told them indignantly that I had nursed you on my knee;
that I<br>
watched you from infancy to boyhood, from boy to man; that he of
whose<br>
stock you came had one feeling paramount to all, his love of his
own<br>
fatherland, and that you would not disgrace him. Besides,
Charley, there's<br>
not an humble hearth for many a long mile around us, where,
amidst the<br>
winter's blast, tempered not excluded, by frail walls and
poverty,&mdash;there's<br>
not one such but where poor Godfrey's name rises each night in
prayer, and<br>
blessings are invoked on him by those who never felt them
themselves."</p>

<p>"I'll not desert them."</p>

<p>"I know you'll not, boy, I know you'll not. Now for the
means."</p>

<p>Here he entered into a long and complicated exposure of my
dear uncle's<br>
many difficulties, by which it appeared that, in order to leave
the estate<br>
free of debt to me, he had for years past undergone severe
privations.<br>
These, however,&mdash;such is the misfortune of an unguided
effort,&mdash;had but<br>
ill succeeded, and there was scarcely a farm on the property
without its<br>
mortgage. Upon the house and demesne a bond for three thousand
pounds still<br>
remained; and to pay off this, Considine advised my selling a
portion of<br>
the property.</p>

<p>"It's old Blake lent the money; and only a week before your
uncle died,<br>
he served a notice for repayment. I never told Godfrey; it was no
use. It<br>
could only embitter his last few hours; and, besides, we had six
months to<br>
think of it. The half of that time has now elapsed, however; we
must see to<br>
this."</p>

<p>"And did Blake really make this demand, knowing my poor
uncle's<br>
difficulties?"</p>

<p>"Why, I half think he did not; for Godfrey was too fine a
fellow ever to<br>
acknowledge anything of the sort. He had twelve sheep killed for
the poor<br>
in Scariff, at a time when not a servant of the house tasted meat
for<br>
months; ay, and our own table, too, none of the most abundant, I
assure<br>
you."</p>

<p>What a picture was this, and how forcibly did it remind me of
what I had<br>
witnessed in times past. Thus meditating, we returned to the
house; and<br>
Considine, whose activity never slumbered, sat down to con over
the<br>
rent-roll with old Maguire the steward.</p>

<p>When I joined the count in the evening, I found him surrounded
by maps,<br>
rent-rolls, surveys, and leases. He had been poring over these
various<br>
documents, to ascertain from which portion of the property we
could best<br>
recruit our failing finances. To judge from the embarrassed look
and manner<br>
with which he met me, the matter was one of no small difficulty.
The<br>
encumbrances upon the estate had been incurred with an unsparing
hand; and<br>
except where some irreclaimable tract of bog or mountain rendered
a loan<br>
impracticable, each portion of the property had its share of
debt.</p>

<p>"You can't sell Killantry, for Basset has above six thousand
pounds on it<br>
already. To be sure, there's the Priest's Meadows,&mdash;fine land and
in good<br>
heart; but Malony was an old tenant of the family, and I cannot
recommend<br>
your turning him over to a stranger. The widow M'Bride's farm is
perhaps<br>
the best, after all, and it would certainly bring the sum we
want; still,<br>
poor Mary was your nurse, Charley, and it would break her heart
to do it."</p>

<p>Thus, wherever we turned, some obstacle presented itself, if
not from<br>
moneyed causes, at least from those ties and associations which,
in an<br>
attached and faithful tenantry, are sure to grow up between them
and the<br>
owner of the soil.</p>

<p>Feeling how all-important these things were&mdash;endeavoring as I
was to fulfil<br>
the will and work out the intentions of my uncle&mdash;I saw at once
that to<br>
sell any portion of the property must separate me, to a certain
extent,<br>
from those who long looked up to our house, and who, in the
feudalism of<br>
the west, could ill withdraw their allegiance from their own
chief to swear<br>
fealty to a stranger. The richer tenants were those whose
industry and<br>
habits rendered them objects of worth and attachment; to the
poorer ones,<br>
to whose improvidence and whose follies (if you will) their
poverty was<br>
owing, I was bound by those ties which the ancient habit of my
house had<br>
contracted for centuries. The bond of benefit conferred can be
stronger<br>
than the debt of gratitude itself. What was I then to do? My
income would<br>
certainly permit of my paying the interest upon my several
mortgages, and<br>
still retaining wherewithal to live; the payment of Blake's bond
was my<br>
only difficulty, and small as it was, it was still a
difficulty.</p>

<p>"I have it, Charley!" said Considine; "I've found out the way
of doing it.<br>
Blake will have no objection, I'm sure, to take the widow's farm
in payment<br>
of his debt, giving you a power of redemption within five years.
In that<br>
time, what with economy, some management, perhaps," added he,
smiling<br>
slightly,&mdash;"perhaps a wife with money may relieve all your
embarrassments<br>
at once. Well, well, I know you are not thinking of that just
now; but<br>
come, what say you to my plan?"</p>

<p>"I know not well what to say. It seems to be the best; but
still I have my<br>
misgivings."</p>

<p>"Of course you have, my boy; nor could I love you if you'd
part with an old<br>
and faithful follower without them. But, after all, she is only a
hostage<br>
to the enemy; we'll win her back, Charley."</p>

<p>"If you think so&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I do. I know it."</p>

<p>"Well, then, be it so; only one thing I bargain,&mdash;she must
herself consent<br>
to this change of masters. It will seem to her a harsh measure
that the<br>
child she had nursed and fondled in her arms should live to
disunite her<br>
from those her oldest attachments upon earth. We must take care,
sir, that<br>
Blake cannot dispossess her; this would be too hard."</p>

<p>"No, no; that we'll guard against. And now, Charley, with
prudence and<br>
caution, we'll clear off every encumbrance, and O'Malley Castle
shall yet<br>
be what it was in days of yore. Ay, boy, with the descendant of
the old<br>
house for its master, and not that general&mdash;how do you call
him?&mdash;that came<br>
down here to contest the county, who with his offer of thirty
thousand<br>
pounds thought to uproot the oldest family of the west. Did I
ever show you<br>
the letter we wrote him?"</p>

<p>"No, sir," replied I, trembling with agitation as I spoke;
"you merely<br>
alluded to it in one of yours."</p>

<p>"Look here, lad!" said he, drawing it from the recesses of a
black leather<br>
pocket-book. "I took a copy of it; read that."</p>

<p>The document was dated, "O'Malley Castle, December 9th." It
ran thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>    Sir,&mdash;I have this moment learned from my agent, that you,
or<br>
    some one empowered by you for the purpose, made an offer of
several<br>
    thousand pounds to buy up the different mortgages upon my
property,<br>
    with a subsequent intention of becoming its possessor. Now,
sir, I<br>
    beg to tell you, that if your ungentlemanlike and underhand
plot<br>
    had succeeded, you dared not darken with your shadow the
door-sill<br>
    of the house you purchased. Neither your gold nor your
flattery&mdash;and<br>
    I hear you are rich in both&mdash;could wipe out from the
minds<br>
    and hearts of my poor tenantry the kindness of centuries. Be
advised,<br>
    then, sir; withdraw your offer; let a Galway gentleman
settle<br>
    his own difficulties his own way; his troubles and cares are
quite<br>
    sufficient, without your adding to them. There can be but
one<br>
    mode in which your interference with him could be deemed
acceptable:<br>
    need I tell you, sir, who are a soldier, how that is? As
I<br>
    know your official duties are important, and as my
nephew&mdash;who<br>
    feels with me perfectly in this business&mdash;is abroad, I can
only say<br>
    that failing health and a broken frame shall not prevent my
undertaking<br>
    a journey to England, should my doing so meet your wishes<br>
    on this occasion. I am, sir,</p>

<p>    Your obedient servant,              GODFREY O'MALLEY.</p>

<p>"This letter," continued Considine, "I enclosed in an
envelope, with the<br>
following few lines of my own:"&mdash;</p>

<p>    "Count Considine presents his compliments to
Lieutenant-General<br>
    Dashwood; and feeling that as the friend of Mr. Godfrey
O'Malley,<br>
    the mild course pursued by that gentleman may possibly be
attributed<br>
    to his suggestion, he begs to assure General Dashwood that
the reverse<br>
    was the case, and that he strenuously counselled the
propriety<br>
    of laying a horsewhip upon the general's shoulders, as a
preliminary<br>
    step in the transaction.</p>

<p>    "Count Considine's address is No. 16 Kildare Street."</p>

<p>"Great God!" said I, "is this possible?"</p>

<p>"Well may you say so, my boy: for&mdash;would you believe
it?&mdash;after all that,<br>
he writes a long blundering apology, protesting I know not what
about<br>
motives of former friendship, and terminating with a civil hint
that we<br>
have done with him forever. And of my paragraph he takes no
notice; and<br>
thus ends the whole affair."</p>

<p>"And with it my last hope also!" muttered I to myself.</p>

<p>That Sir George Dashwood's intentions had been misconstrued
and mistaken I<br>
knew perfectly well; that nothing but the accumulated evils of
poverty and<br>
sickness could have induced my poor uncle to write such a letter
I was<br>
well aware; but now the mischief was accomplished, the evil was
done, and<br>
nothing remained but to bear with patience and submission, and to
endeavor<br>
to forget what thus became irremediable.</p>

<p>"Sir George Dashwood made no allusion to me, sir, in his
reply?" inquired<br>
I, catching at anything like a hope.</p>

<p>"Your name never occurs in his letter. But you look pale, boy;
all these<br>
discussions come too early upon you; besides, you stay too much
at home,<br>
and take no exercise."</p>

<p>So saying, Considine bustled off towards the stables to look
after some<br>
young horses that had just been taken up; and I walked out alone
to ponder<br>
over what I had heard, and meditate on my plans for the
future.</p>

<br><br><br><br><p>CHAPTER XLIV.</p>

<p>AN OLD ACQUAINTANCE.</p>

<p>As I wandered on, the irritation of my spirit gradually
subsided. It was,<br>
to be sure, distressing to think over the light in which my
uncle's letter<br>
had placed me before Sir George Dashwood, had even my reputation
only with<br>
him been at stake; but with my attachment to his daughter, it
was<br>
almost maddening. And yet there was nothing to be done; to
disavow my<br>
participation would be to throw discredit upon my uncle. Thus
were my hopes<br>
blighted; and thus, at that season when life was opening upon me,
did I<br>
feel careless and indifferent to everything. Had my military
career still<br>
remained to me, that at least would have suggested scenes
sufficient to<br>
distract me from the past; but now my days must be spent where
every spot<br>
teemed with memories of bygone happiness and joys never to come
back again.</p>

<p>My mind was, however, made up; and without speaking a word to
Considine, I<br>
turned homeward, and sat down at my writing-table. In a few brief
lines I<br>
informed my army agent of my intention of leaving the service,
and desired<br>
that he would sell out for me at once. Fearing lest my resolution
might not<br>
be proof against the advice and solicitation of my friends, I
cautioned him<br>
against giving my address, or any clew by which letters might
reach me.</p>

<p>This done, I addressed a short note to Mr. Blake, requesting
to know the<br>
name of his solicitor, in whose hands the bond was placed, and
announcing<br>
my intention of immediate repayment.</p>

<p>Trifling as these details were in themselves, I cannot help
recording how<br>
completely they changed the whole current of my thoughts. A new
train of<br>
interests began to spring up within me; and where so lately the
clang of<br>
the battle, the ardor of the march, the careless ease of the
bivouac, had<br>
engrossed every feeling, now more humble and homely thoughts
succeeded; and<br>
as my personal ambition had lost its stimulant, I turned with
pleasure to<br>
those of whose fate and fortunes I was in some sort the guardian.
There may<br>
be many a land where the verdure blooms more in fragrance and in
richness,<br>
where the clime breathes softer, and a brighter sky lights up
the<br>
landscape; but there is none&mdash;I have travelled through many a
one&mdash;where<br>
more touching and heart-bound associations are blended with the
features<br>
of the soil than in Ireland, and cold must be the spirit, and
barren the<br>
affections of him who can dwell amidst its mountains and its
valleys, its<br>
tranquil lakes, its wooded fens, without feeling their humanizing
influence<br>
upon him. Thus gradually new impressions and new duties
succeeded; and ere<br>
four months elapsed, the quiet monotony of my daily life healed
up the<br>
wounds of my suffering, and in the calm current of my present
existence, a<br>
sense of content, if not of happiness, crept gently over me, and
I ceased<br>
to long for the clash of arms and the loud blast of the
trumpet.</p>

<p>Unlike all my former habits, I completely abandoned the sports
of the<br>
field. He who had participated in them with me was no longer
there; and the<br>
very sight of the tackle itself suggested sad and depressing
thoughts.</p>

<p>My horses I took but little pleasure in. To gratify the good
and kind<br>
people about, I would walk through the stables, and make some
passing<br>
remark, as if to show some interest; but I felt it not. No; it
was only by<br>
the total change of all the ordinary channels of my ideas that I
could bear<br>
up; and now my days were passed in the fields, either listlessly
strolling<br>
along, or in watching the laborers as they worked. Of my
neighbors I saw<br>
nothing; returning their cards, when they called upon me, was the
extent of<br>
our intercourse; and I had no desire for any further. As
Considine had left<br>
me to visit some friends in the south, I was quite alone, and for
the first<br>
time in my life, felt how soothing can be such solitude. In each
happy<br>
face, in every grateful look around me, I felt that I was
fulfilling my<br>
uncle's last behest; and the sense of duty, so strong when it
falls upon<br>
the heart accompanied by the sense of power, made my days pass
rapidly<br>
away.</p>

<p>It was towards the close of autumn, when I one morning
received a letter<br>
from London, informing me that my troop had been sold, and the
purchase<br>
money&mdash;above four thousand pounds&mdash;lodged to my credit at my
banker's.</p>

<p>As Mr. Blake had merely answered my former note by a civil
message that the<br>
matter in question was by no means pressing, I lost not a moment,
when<br>
this news reached me, to despatch Mike to Gurt-na-Morra with a
few lines,<br>
expressing my anxious desire to finish the transaction, and
begging of Mr.<br>
Blake to appoint a day for the purpose.</p>

<p>To this application Mr. Blake's reply was, that he would do
himself the<br>
honor of waiting upon me the following day, when the arrangements
I desired<br>
could be agreed upon. Now this was exactly what I wished, if
possible,<br>
to avoid. Of all my neighbors, he was the one I predetermined to
have no<br>
intercourse with; I had not forgotten my last evening at his
house, nor had<br>
I forgiven his conduct to my uncle. However, there was nothing
for it but<br>
submission; the interview need not be a long, and it should be a
last one.<br>
Thus resolving, I waited in patience for the morrow.</p>

<p>I was seated at my breakfast the next morning, conning between
whiles the<br>
columns of the last paper, and feeding my spaniel, who sat upon a
large<br>
chair beside me, when the door opened, and the servant announced,
"Mr.<br>
Blake;" and the instant after that gentleman bustled in holding
out both<br>
his hands with all evidences of most friendly warmth, and calling
out,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Charley O'Malley, my lad! I'm delighted to see you at
last!"</p>

<p>Now, although the distance from the door to the table at which
I sat<br>
was not many paces, yet it was quite sufficient to chill down all
my<br>
respectable relative's ardor before he approached: his rapid pace
became<br>
gradually a shuffle, a slide, and finally a dead stop; his
extended arms<br>
were reduced to one hand, barely advanced beyond his waistcoat;
his voice,<br>
losing the easy confidence of its former tone, got husky and dry,
and broke<br>
into a cough; and all these changes were indebted to the mere
fact of<br>
my reception of him consisting in a cold and distant bow, as I
told the<br>
servant to place a chair and leave the room.</p>

<p>Without any preliminary whatever, I opened the subject of our
negotiation,<br>
expressed my regret that it should have waited so long, and my
desire to<br>
complete it.</p>

<p>Whether it was that the firm and resolute tone I assumed had
its effect at<br>
once, or that disappointed at the mode in which I received his
advances he<br>
wished to conclude our interview as soon as need be, I know not;
but he<br>
speedily withdrew from a capacious pocket a document in
parchment, which,<br>
having spread at large upon the table, and having leisurely put
on his<br>
spectacles, he began to hum over its contents to himself in an
undertone.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, here it is," said he. "'Deed of conveyance between
Godfrey<br>
O'Malley, of O'Malley Castle, Esq., on the one part'&mdash;perhaps
you'd like<br>
your solicitor to examine it,&mdash;'and Blake, of Gurt'&mdash;because
there is no<br>
hurry, Captain O'Malley&mdash;'on the other.' In fact, after all, it
is a mere<br>
matter of form between relatives," said he, as I declined the
intervention<br>
of a lawyer. "I'm not in want of the money&mdash;'all the lands and
tenements<br>
adjoining, in trust, for the payment of the said three
thousand'&mdash;thank<br>
God, Captain, the sum is a trifle that does not inconvenience me!
The boys<br>
are provided for; and the girls&mdash;the pickpockets, as I call them,
ha,<br>
ha, ha!&mdash;not ill off neither;&mdash;'with rights of turbary on the
said<br>
premises'&mdash;who are most anxious to have the pleasure of seeing
you. Indeed,<br>
I could scarcely keep Jane from coming over to-day. 'Sure he's my
cousin,'<br>
says she; 'and what harm would it be if I went to see him?'
Wild,<br>
good-natured girls, Captain! And your old friend Matthew&mdash;you
haven't<br>
forgot Matthew?&mdash;has been keeping three coveys of partridge for
you<br>
this fortnight. 'Charley,' says he,&mdash;they call you Charley
still,<br>
Captain,&mdash;'shall have them, and no one else.' And poor Mary&mdash;she
was<br>
a child when you were here&mdash;Mary is working a sash for you. But
I'm<br>
forgetting&mdash;I know you have so much business on your hands&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Pray, Mr. Blake, be seated. I know nothing of any more
importance than the<br>
matter before us. If you will permit me to give you a check for
this money.<br>
The papers, I'm sure, are perfectly correct."</p>

<p>"If I only thought it did not inconvenience you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Nothing of the kind, I assure you. Shall I say at sight, or
in ten days<br>
hence?"</p>

<p>"Whenever you please, Captain. But it's sorry I am to come
troubling you<br>
about such things, when I know you are thinking of other matters.
And, as<br>
I said before, the money does not signify to me; the times, thank
God, are<br>
good, and I've never been very improvident."</p>

<p>"I think you'll find that correct."</p>

<p>"Oh, to be sure it is! Well, well; I'm going away without
saying half what<br>
I intended."</p>

<p>"Pray do not hurry yourself. I have not asked have you
breakfasted, for I<br>
remember Galway habits too well for that. But if I might offer
you a glass<br>
of sherry and water after your ride?"</p>

<p>"Will you think me a beast if I say yes, Captain? Time was
when I didn't<br>
care for a canter of ten or fifteen miles in the morning no more
than<br>
yourself; and that's no small boast; God forgive me, but I never
see that<br>
clover-field where you pounded the Englishman, without swearing
there never<br>
was a leap made before or since. Is this Mickey, Captain? Faith,
and it's<br>
a fine, brown, hearty-looking chap you're grown, Mickey. That's
mighty<br>
pleasant sherry, but where would there be good wine if it wasn't
here? Oh,<br>
I remember now what it was I wanted. Peter,&mdash;my son Peter, a slip
of a boy,<br>
he's only sixteen,&mdash;well, d'you see, he's downright deranged
about the<br>
army: he used to see your name in the papers every day, and that
terrible<br>
business at&mdash;what's the name of the place?&mdash;where you rode on the
chap's<br>
back up the breach."</p>

<p>"Ciudad Rodrigo, perhaps," said I, scarcely able to repress a
laugh.</p>

<p>"Well, sir, since that he'll hear of nothing but going into
the army; ay,<br>
and into the dragoons too. Now, Captain, isn't it mighty
expensive in the<br>
dragoons?"</p>

<p>"Why, no, not particularly so,&mdash;at least in the regiment I
served with."</p>

<p>"I promised him I'd ask you; the boy's mad, that's the fact. I
wish,<br>
Captain, you'd just reason with him a little; he'll mind what you
say,<br>
there's no fear of that. And you see, though I'd like to do
what's fair,<br>
I'm not going to cut off the girls for the sake of the boys; with
the<br>
blessing of Providence, they'll never be able to reproach me for
that. What<br>
I say is this: treat <i>me</i> well, and I'll treat you the same.
Marry the man<br>
my choice would pick out for you, and it's not a matter of a
thousand or<br>
two I'll care for. There was Bodkin&mdash;you remember him?" said he,
with a<br>
grin; "he proposed for Mary, but since the quarrel with you, she
could<br>
never bear the sight of him, and Alley wouldn't come down to
dinner if he<br>
was in the house. Mary's greatly altered; I wish you heard her
sing 'I'd<br>
mourn the hopes that leave me.' Queer girl she is; she was little
more<br>
than a child when you were here, and she remembers you just as if
it was<br>
yesterday."</p>

<p>While Mr. Blake ran on at this rate, now dilating upon my own
manifold<br>
virtues and accomplishments, now expatiating upon the more
congenial<br>
theme,&mdash;the fascinations of his fair daughters, and the various
merits of<br>
his sons,&mdash;I could not help feeling how changed our relative
position was<br>
since our last meeting; the tone of cool and vulgar patronage he
then<br>
assumed towards the unformed country lad was now converted into
an air of<br>
fawning and deferential submission, still more distasteful.</p>

<p>Young as I was, however, I had already seen a good deal of the
world; my<br>
soldiering had at least taught me something of men, and I had far
less<br>
difficulty in deciphering the intentions and objects of my worthy
relative,<br>
than I should have had in the enigmatical mazes of the parchment
bond of<br>
which he was the bearer. After all, to how very narrow an extent
in life<br>
are we fashioned by our own estimate of ourselves! My changed
condition<br>
affected me but little until I saw how it affected others; that
the<br>
position I occupied should seem better now that life had lost the
great<br>
stimulus of ambition, was somewhat strange; and that flattery
should pay<br>
its homage to the mourning coat which it would have refused to my
soldier's<br>
garb, somewhat surprised me. Still my bettered fortunes shone
only brightly<br>
by reflected light; for in my own heart I was sad, spiritless,
and<br>
oppressed.</p>

<p>Feeling somewhat ashamed at the coldness with which I treated
a man so much<br>
my elder, I gradually assumed towards Mr. Blake a manner less
reserved. He<br>
quickly availed himself of the change, and launched out into an
eloquent<br>
<i>expos&eacute;</i> of my advantages and capabilities; the only
immediate effect of<br>
which was to convince me that my property and my prospects must
have been<br>
very accurately conned over and considered by that worthy
gentleman before<br>
he could speak of the one or the other with such perfect
knowledge.</p>

<p>"When you get rid of these little encumbrances, your rent-roll
will be<br>
close on four thousand a year. There's Bassett, sure, by only
reducing his<br>
interest from ten to five per cent, will give you a clear eight
hundred per<br>
annum; let him refuse, and I'll advance the money. And, besides,
look at<br>
Freney's farm; there's two hundred acres let for one third of the
value,<br>
and you must look to these tilings; for, you see, Captain, we'll
want you<br>
to go into Parliament; you can't help coming forward at the next
election,<br>
and by the great gun of Athlone, we'll return you."</p>

<p>Here Mr. Blake swallowed a full bumper of sherry, and getting
up a little<br>
false enthusiasm for the moment, grasped me by both hands and
shook me<br>
violently; this done, like a skilful general, who, having fired
the last<br>
shot of his artillery, takes care to secure his retreat, he
retired towards<br>
the door, where his hat and coat were lying.</p>

<p>"I've a hundred apologies to make for encroaching upon your
time; but, upon<br>
my soul, Captain, you are so agreeable, and the hours have passed
away so<br>
pleasantly&mdash;May I never, if it is not one o'clock!&mdash;but you must
forgive<br>
me."</p>

<p>My sense of justice, which showed me that the agreeability had
all been on<br>
Mr. Blake's side, prevented me from acknowledging this compliment
as it<br>
deserved; so I merely bowed stiffly, without speaking. By this
time he had<br>
succeeded in putting on his great-coat, but still, by some
mischance or<br>
other, the moment of his leaving-taking was deferred; one time he
buttoned<br>
it awry, and had to undo it all again; then, when it was properly
adjusted,<br>
he discovered that his pocket-handkerchief was not available,
being left in<br>
the inner coat-pocket; to this succeeded a doubt as to the safety
of the<br>
check, which instituted another search, and it was full ten
minutes before<br>
he was completely caparisoned and ready for the road.</p>

<p>"Good-by, Captain, good-by!" said he warmly, yet warily, not
knowing at<br>
what precise temperature the metal of my heart was fusible. At a
mild heat<br>
I had been evidently unsinged, and the white glow of his flattery
seemed<br>
only to harden me. The interview was now over, and as I thought
sufficient<br>
had been done to convince my friend that the terms of distant
acquaintance<br>
were to be the limits of our future intercourse, I assumed a
little show of<br>
friendliness, and shook his hand warmly.</p>

<p>"Good-by, Mr. Blake; pray present my respectful compliments to
your<br>
friends. Allow me to ring for your horse; you are not going to
have a<br>
shower, I hope."</p>

<p>"No, no, Captain, only a passing cloud," said he, warming up
perceptibly<br>
under the influence of my advances, "nothing more. Why, what is
it I'm<br>
forgetting now! Oh, I have it! May be I'm too bold; but sure an
old friend<br>
and relation may take a liberty sometimes. It was just a little
request<br>
of Mrs. Blake, as I was leaving the house." He stopped here as if
to take<br>
soundings, and perceiving no change in my countenance, continued:
"It was<br>
just to beg, that, in a kind and friendly way, you'd come over
and eat your<br>
dinner with us on Sunday; nobody but the family, not a soul&mdash;Mrs.
Blake and<br>
the girls; a boiled leg of mutton; Matthew; a fresh trout, if we
can catch<br>
one! Plain and homely, but a hearty welcome, and a bottle of old
claret,<br>
may be, too&mdash;ah! ah! ah!"</p>

<p>Before the cadence of Mr. Blake's laugh had died away, I
politely but<br>
resolutely declined the proffered invitation, and by way of
setting the<br>
question at rest forever, gave him to understand that, from
impaired health<br>
and other causes, I had resolved upon strictly confining myself
to the<br>
limits of my own house and grounds, at least for the present.</p>

<p>Mr. Blake then saluted me for the last time, and left the
room. As he<br>
mounted his hackney, I could not help overhearing an abortive
effort he<br>
made to draw Mike into something like conversation; but it proved
an utter<br>
failure, and it was evident he deemed the man as incorrigible as
the<br>
master.</p>

<p>"A very fine young man the captain is&mdash;remarkable!&mdash;and it's
proud I am to<br>
have him for a nephew!"</p>

<p>So saying, he cantered down the avenue, while Mickey, as he
looked after<br>
him, muttered between his teeth, "And faix, it's prouder you'd be
av he was<br>
your son-in-law!"</p>

<p>Mike's soliloquy seemed to show me, in a new light, the
meaning of my<br>
relative's manner. It was for the first time in my life that such
a thought<br>
had occurred to me, and it was not without a sense of shame that
I now<br>
admitted it.</p>

<p>If there be something which elevates and exalts us in our
esteem, tinging<br>
our hearts with heroism and our souls with pride, in the love
and<br>
attachment of some fair and beautiful girl, there is something
equally<br>
humiliating in being the object of cold and speculative
calculation to a<br>
match-making family: your character studied; your pursuits
watched; your<br>
tastes conned over; your very temperament inquired into;
surrounded<br>
by snares; environed by practised attentions; one eye fixed upon
the<br>
registered testament of your relative, the other riveted upon
your own<br>
caprices; and then those thousand little cares and kindnesses
which come so<br>
pleasurably upon the heart when the offspring of true affection,
perverted<br>
as they are by base views and sordid interest, are so many shocks
to the<br>
feeling and understanding. Like the Eastern sirocco, which seems
to breathe<br>
of freshness and of health, and yet bears but pestilence and
death upon its<br>
breezes,&mdash;so these calculated and well-considered traits of
affection only<br>
render callous and harden the heart which had responded warmly,
openly, and<br>
abundantly to the true outpourings of affection. At how many a
previously<br>
happy hearth has the seed of this fatal passion planted its
discord! How<br>
many a fair and lovely girl, with beauty and attractions
sufficient to<br>
win all that her heart could wish of fondness and devotion, has,
by this<br>
pernicious passion, become a cold, heartless, worldly coquette,
weighing<br>
men's characters by the adventitious circumstances of their birth
and<br>
fortune, and scrutinizing the eligibility of a match with the
practised<br>
acumen with which a notary investigates the solvency of a
creditor. How do<br>
the traits of beauty, gesture, voice, and manner become converted
into the<br>
common-place and distasteful trickery of the world! The very
hospitality of<br>
the house becomes suspect, their friendship is but fictitious;
those rare<br>
and goodly gifts of fondness and sisterly affection which grow up
in<br>
happier circumstances, are here but rivalry, envy, and
ill-conceived<br>
hatred. The very accomplishments which cultivate and adorn life,
that light<br>
but graceful frieze which girds the temple of homely happiness,
are here<br>
but the meditated and well-considered occasions of display. All
the bright<br>
features of womanhood, all the freshness of youth, and all its
fascinations<br>
are but like those richly-colored and beautiful fruits, seductive
to the<br>
eye and fair to look upon, but which within contain nothing but a
core of<br>
rottenness and decay.</p>

<p>No, no; unblessed by all which makes a hearth a home, I may
travel on my<br>
weary way through life; but such a one as this I will not make
the partner<br>
of my sorrows and my joys, come what will of it!</p>

<br><br><br><br><p>CHAPTER XLV.</p>

<p>A SURPRISE.</p>

<p>From the hour of Mr. Blake's departure, my life was no longer
molested. My<br>
declaration, which had evidently, under his auspices, been made
the subject<br>
of conversation through the country, was at least so far
successful, as<br>
it permitted me to spend my time in the way I liked best, and
without the<br>
necessity of maintaining the show of intercourse, when in reality
I kept<br>
up none, with the neighborhood. While thus, therefore, my life
passed on<br>
equably and tranquilly, many mouths glided over, and I found
myself already<br>
a year at home, without it appearing more than a few weeks.
Nothing seems<br>
so short in retrospect as monotony; the number, the variety, the
interest<br>
of the events which occupy us, making our hours pass glibly and
flowingly,<br>
will still suggest to the mind the impressions of a longer period
than<br>
when the daily routine of our occupations assumes a character of
continued<br>
uniformity. It seems to be the <i>amende</i> made by hours of
weariness and<br>
tedium, that, in looking back upon them, they appear to have
passed rapidly<br>
over. Not that my life, at the period I speak of, was devoid of
interest;<br>
on the contrary, devoting myself with zeal and earnestness to the
new<br>
duties of my station, I made myself thoroughly acquainted with
the<br>
condition of my property, the interest of my tenantry, their
prospects,<br>
their hopes, their objects. Investigating them as only he can who
is<br>
the owner of the soil, I endeavored to remedy the ancient vices
of the<br>
land,&mdash;the habits of careless, reckless waste, of indifference
for the<br>
morrow; and by instilling a feature of prudent foresight into
that<br>
boundless confidence in the future upon which every Irishman of
every<br>
rank lives and trusts, I succeeded at last in so far ameliorating
their<br>
situation, that a walk through my property, instead of
presenting&mdash;as it<br>
at first did&mdash;a crowd of eager and anxious supplicants,
entreating for<br>
abatements in rent, succor for their sick, and sometimes even
food itself,<br>
showed me now a happy and industrious people, confident in
themselves, and<br>
firmly relying on their own resources.</p>

<p>Another spring was now opening, and a feeling of calm and
tranquil<br>
happiness, the result of my successful management of my estate,
made my<br>
days pass pleasantly along. I was sitting at a late breakfast in
my little<br>
library; the open window afforded a far and wide prospect of the
country,<br>
blooming in all the promise of the season, while the drops of the
passing<br>
shower still lingered upon the grass, and were sparkling like
jewels under<br>
the bright sunshine. Masses of white and billowy cloud moved
swiftly<br>
through the air, coloring the broad river with many a shadow as
they<br>
passed. The birds sang merrily, the trees shook their leaves in
concert,<br>
and there was that sense of movement in everything on earth and
sky which<br>
gives to spring its character of lightness and exhilaration. The
youth of<br>
the year, like the youth of our own existence, is beautiful in
the restless<br>
activity which marks it. The tender flower that seems to open as
we look;<br>
the grass that springs before our eyes,&mdash;all speak of promise.
The changing<br>
phases of the sky, like the smiles and tears of infancy, excite
without<br>
weariness, and while they engage our sympathies, they fatigue not
our<br>
compassion.</p>

<p>Partly lost in thought as I looked upon the fair and varied
scene before<br>
me, now turning to the pages of the book upon the
breakfast-table, the<br>
hours of the morning passed quickly over, and it was already
beyond noon. I<br>
was startled from my revery by sounds which I could scarcely
trust my<br>
ears to believe real. I listened again, and thought I could
detect them<br>
distinctly. It seemed as though some one were rapidly running
over the keys<br>
of a pianoforte, essaying with the voice to follow the notes, and
sometimes<br>
striking two or three bold and successive chords; then a merry
laugh would<br>
follow, and drown all other sounds. "What can it be?" thought I.
"There is,<br>
to be sure, a pianoforte in the large drawing-room; but then, who
would<br>
venture upon such a liberty as this? Besides, who is capable of
it? There,<br>
it can be no inexperienced performer gave that shake; my worthy
housekeeper<br>
never accomplished that!" So saying, I jumped from the
breakfast-table,<br>
and set off in the direction of the sound. A small drawing-room
and the<br>
billiard-room lay between me and the large drawing-room; and as I
traversed<br>
them, the music grew gradually louder. Conjecturing that, whoever
it might<br>
be, the performance would cease on my entrance, I listened for a
few<br>
moments before opening the door. Nothing could be more singular,
nothing<br>
more strange, than the effect of those unaccustomed sounds in
that silent<br>
and deserted place. The character of the music, too, contributed
not<br>
a little to this; rapidly passing from grave to gay, from the
melting<br>
softness of some plaintive air to the reckless hurry and
confusion of an<br>
Irish jig, the player seemed, as it were, to run wild through all
the<br>
floating fancies of his memory; now breaking suddenly off in the
saddest<br>
cadence of a song, the notes would change into some quaint,
old-fashioned<br>
crone, in which the singer seemed so much at home, and gave the
queer<br>
drollery of the words that expression of archness so eminently
the<br>
character of certain Irish airs. "But what the deuce is this?"
said I, as,<br>
rattling over the keys with a flowing but brilliant finger,
she,&mdash;for<br>
it was unquestionably a woman,&mdash;with a clear and sweet voice,
broken by<br>
laughter, began to sing the words of Mr. Bodkin's song, "The Man
for<br>
Galway." When she had finished the last verse, her hand strayed,
as it<br>
were, carelessly across the instrument, while she herself gave
way to a<br>
free burst of merriment; and then, suddenly resuming the air, she
chanted<br>
forth the following words, with a spirit and effect I can convey
no idea<br>
of:&mdash;</p>

<p>    "To live at home,<br>
    And never roam;<br>
    To pass his days in sighing;<br>
    To wear sad looks,<br>
    Read stupid books,<br>
    And look half dead or dying;<br>
    Not show his face,<br>
    Nor join the chase,<br>
    But dwell a hermit always:<br>
    Oh, Charley, dear!<br>
    To me 'tis clear,<br>
    You're not the man for Galway!"</p>

<p>"You're not the man for Galway!" repeated she once more, while
she closed<br>
the piano with a loud bang.</p>

<p>"And why not, my dear, why not the man for Galway?" said I,
as, bursting<br>
open the door, I sprang into the room.</p>

<p>"Oh, it's you, is it?&mdash;at last! So I've unearthed you, have
I?"</p>

<p>With these words she burst into an immoderate fit of laughter;
leaving me,<br>
who intended to be the party giving the surprise, amazed,
confused, and<br>
speechless, in the middle of the floor.</p>

<p>[BABY BLAKE.]</p>
<br><br>

<p>That my reader may sympathize a little in my distresses, let
me present him<br>
with the <i>tableau</i> before me. Seated upon the piano-stool was a
young-lady<br>
of at most eighteen years: her face, had it not been for its
expression of<br>
exuberant drollery and malicious fun, would have been downright
beautiful;<br>
her eyes, of the deepest blue, and shaded by long lashes, instead
of<br>
indulging the character of pensive and thoughtful beauty for
which Nature<br>
destined them, sparkled with a most animated brightness; her
nose,<br>
which, rather short, was still beautifully proportioned, gave,
with<br>
her well-curled upper lip, a look of sauciness to the features
quite<br>
bewitching; her hair&mdash;that brilliant auburn we see in a <i>Carlo
Dolci</i>&mdash;fell<br>
in wild and massive curls upon her shoulders. Her costume was a
dark-green<br>
riding-habit, not of the newest in its fashion, and displaying
more than<br>
one rent in its careless folds; her hat, whip, and gloves lay on
the floor<br>
beside her, and her whole attitude and bearing indicated the most
perfect<br>
ease and carelessness.</p>

<p>"So you are caught&mdash;taken alive!" said she, as she pressed her
hands upon<br>
her sides in a fresh burst of laughter.</p>

<p>"By Jove! this is a surprise indeed!" said I. "And, pray, into
whose fair<br>
hands have I fallen a captive?" recovering myself a little, and
assuming a<br>
half air of gallantry.</p>

<p>"So you don't know me, don't you?"</p>

<p>"Upon my life I do not!"</p>

<p>"How good! Why, I'm Baby Blake."</p>

<p>"Baby Blake?" said I, thinking that a rather strange
appellation for one<br>
whose well-developed proportions betokened nothing of
infancy,&mdash;"Baby<br>
Blake?"</p>

<p>"To be sure; your cousin Baby."</p>

<p>"Indeed!" said I, springing forward. "Let me embrace my
relative."<br>
Accepting my proffered salutation with the most exemplary
coolness, she<br>
said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Get a chair, now, and let's have a talk together."</p>

<p>"Why the devil do they call you Baby?" said I, still puzzled
by this<br>
palpable misnomer.</p>

<p>"Because I am the youngest, and I was always the baby,"
replied she,<br>
adjusting her ringlets with a most rural coquetry. "Now tell me
something.<br>
Why do you live shut up here like a madman, and not come near us
at<br>
Gurt-na-Morra?"</p>

<p>"Oh, that's a long story, Baby. But, since we are asking
questions, how did<br>
you get in here?"</p>

<p>"Just through the window, my dear; and I've torn my habit, as
you see."</p>

<p>So saying, she exhibited a rent of about two feet long,
thrusting through<br>
it a very pretty foot and ankle at the same time.</p>

<p>"As my inhospitable customs have cost you a habit, you must
let me make you<br>
a present of one."</p>

<p>"No, will you though? That's a good fellow. Lord! I told them
I knew you<br>
weren't a miser; that you were only odd, that's all."</p>

<p>"And how did you come over, Baby?"</p>

<p>"Just cantered over with little Paddy Byrne. I made him take
all the walls<br>
and ditches we met, and they're scraping the mud off him ever
since. I'm<br>
glad I made you laugh, Charley; they say you are so sad. Dear me,
how<br>
thirsty I am! Have you any beer?"</p>

<p>"To be sure, Baby. But wouldn't you like some luncheon?"</p>

<p>"Of all things. Well, this is fun!" said she, as taking my
arm, I led her<br>
from the drawing-room. "They don't know where I'm gone,&mdash;not one
of them;<br>
and I've a great mind not to tell them, if you wouldn't
blab."</p>

<p>"Would it be quite proper?"</p>

<p>"Proper!" cried she, imitating my voice. "I like that! as if I
was going to<br>
run away with you! Dear me, what a pretty house, and what nice
pictures!<br>
Who is the old fellow up there in the armor?"</p>

<p>"That's Sir Hildebrand O'Malley," said I, with some pride in
recognizing an<br>
ancestor of the thirteenth century.</p>

<p>"And the other old fright with the wig, and his hands stuck in
his<br>
pockets?"</p>

<p>"My grandfather, Baby."</p>

<p>"Lord, how ugly he is! Why, Charley, he hasn't the look of
you. One would<br>
think, too, he was angry at us. Ay, old gentleman, you don't like
to see me<br>
leaning on Cousin Charley's arm! That must be the luncheon; I'm
sure I hear<br>
knives and forks rattling there."</p>

<p>The old butler's astonishment was not inferior to my own a few
minutes<br>
before, when I entered the dining-room with my fair cousin upon
my arm.<br>
As I drew a chair towards the table, a thought struck me that
possibly<br>
it might only be a due attention to my fair guest if I invited
the<br>
housekeeper, Mrs. Magra, to favor us with her presence; and
accordingly, in<br>
an undertone, so as not to be overheard by old Simon, I
said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Perhaps, Baby, you'd like to have Mrs. Magra to keep us
company?"</p>

<p>"Who's she?" was the brief answer.</p>

<p>"The housekeeper; a very respectable old matron."</p>

<p>"Is she funny?"</p>

<p>"Funny! not a bit."</p>

<p>"Oh, then, never mind her. What made you think of her?"</p>

<p>"Why, I thought, perhaps you'd think&mdash;That is people might
say&mdash;In fact I<br>
was doing a little bit proper on your account."</p>

<p>"Oh, that was it, was it? Thank you for nothing, my dear; Baby
Blake can<br>
take care of herself. And now just help me to that wing there. Do
you know,<br>
Cousin Charley, I think you're an old quiz, and not half as good
a fellow<br>
as you used to be?"</p>

<p>"Come, come, Baby, don't be in such a hurry to pronounce upon
me. Let us<br>
take a glass of wine. Fill Miss Blake's glass, Simon."</p>

<p>"Well, you may be better when one comes to know you. I detest
sherry. No,<br>
never mind, I'll take it, as it's here. Charley, I'll not
compliment you<br>
upon your ham; they don't know how to save them here. I'll give
you such<br>
a receipt when you come over to see us. But will you come? That's
the<br>
question."</p>

<p>"How can you ask me! Don't you think I'll return your
visit?"</p>

<p>"Oh, hang your ceremony! Come and see us, like a good-natured
fellow that<br>
knew us since we played together and quarrelled over our toys on
the grass.<br>
Is that your sword up there? Did you hear that noise? That was
thunder:<br>
there it comes. Look at that!"</p>

<p>As she spoke, a darkness like night overspread the landscape;
the waves of<br>
the river became greatly agitated, and the rain, descending in
torrents,<br>
beat with tremendous force against the windows; clap after clap
of thunder<br>
followed; the lightning flashed fearfully through the gloom; and
the wind,<br>
growing every moment stronger, drove the rain with redoubled
violence<br>
against the glass. For a while we amused ourselves with watching
the<br>
effects of the storm without: the poor laborers flying from their
work; the<br>
dripping figures seeking shelter beneath the trees; the barques;
the very<br>
loaded carts themselves,&mdash;all interested Miss Baby, whose eye
roved from<br>
the shore to the Shannon, recognizing with a practised eye every
house upon<br>
its banks, and every barque that rocked and pitched beneath the
gale.</p>

<p>"Well, this is pleasant to look out at," said she, at length,
and after the<br>
storm had lasted for above an hour, without evincing any show of
abatement;<br>
"but what's to become of <i>me?</i>"</p>

<p>Now that was the very question I had been asking myself for
the last twenty<br>
minutes without ever being able to find the answer.</p>

<p>"Eh, Charley, what's to become of me?"</p>

<p>"Oh, never fear; one thing's quite certain, you cannot leave
this in such<br>
weather. The river is certainly impassable by this time at the
ford, and to<br>
go by the road is out of the question; it is fully twelve miles.
I have it,<br>
Baby; you, as I've said before, can't leave this, but I can. Now,
I'll go<br>
over to Gurt-na-Morra, and return in the morning to bring you
back; it will<br>
be fine by that time."</p>

<p>"Well, I like your notion. You'll leave me all alone here to
drink tea, I<br>
suppose, with your friend Mrs. Magra. A pleasant evening I'd have
of it;<br>
not a bit&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, Baby, don't be cross; I only meant this arrangement
really for your<br>
sake. I needn't tell you how very much I'd prefer doing the
honors of my<br>
poor house in person."</p>

<p>"Oh, I see what you mean,&mdash;more propers. Well, well, I've a
great deal to<br>
learn; but look, I think its growing lighter."</p>

<p>"No, far from it; it's only that gray mass along the horizon
that always<br>
bodes continual rain."</p>

<p>As the prospect without had little cheering to look upon, we
sat down<br>
beside the fire and chatted away, forgetting very soon in a
hundred mutual<br>
recollections and inquiries, the rain and the wind, the thunder
and the<br>
hurricane. Now and then, as some louder crash would resound above
our<br>
heads, for a moment we would turn to the window, and comment upon
the<br>
dreadful weather; but the next, we had forgotten all about it,
and were<br>
deep in our confabulations.</p>

<p>As for my fair cousin, who at first was full of contrivances
to pass<br>
the time,&mdash;such as the piano, a game at backgammon, chicken
hazard,<br>
battledoor,&mdash;she at last became mightily interested in some of
my<br>
soldiering adventures, and it was six o'clock ere we again
thought that<br>
some final measure must be adopted for restoring Baby to her
friends, or at<br>
least, guarding against the consequences her simple and guileless
nature<br>
might have involved her in.</p>

<p>Mike was called into the conference, and at his suggestion, it
was decided<br>
that we should have out the phaeton, and that I should myself
drive<br>
Miss Blake home; a plan which offered no other difficulties than
this<br>
one,&mdash;namely, that of above thirty horses in my stables, I had
not a single<br>
pair which had ever been harnessed.</p>

<p>This, so far from proving the obstacle I deemed it, seemed, on
the<br>
contrary, to overwhelm Baby with delight.</p>

<p>"Let's have them. Come, Charley, this will be rare fun; we
couldn't have a<br>
team of four, could we?"</p>

<p>"Six, if you like it, my dear coz&mdash;only who's to hold them?
They're young<br>
thorough-breds,&mdash;most of them never backed; some not bitted. In
fact, I<br>
know nothing of my stable. I say, Mike, is there anything fit to
take out?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; there's Miss Wildespin, she's in training, to be
sure; but we<br>
can't help that; and the brown colt they call, 'Billy the
Bolter,'&mdash;they're<br>
the likeliest we have; without your honor would take the two
chestnuts we<br>
took up last week; they're raal devils to go; and if the tackle
will hold<br>
them, they'll bring you to Mr. Blake's door in forty
minutes."</p>

<p>"I vote for the chestnuts," said Baby, slapping her boot with
her<br>
horsewhip.</p>

<p>"I move an amendment in favor of Miss Wildespin," said I,
doubtfully.</p>

<p>"He'll never do for Galway," sang Baby, laying her whip on my
shoulder with<br>
no tender hand; "yet you used to cross the country in good style
when you<br>
were here before."</p>

<p>"And might do so again, Baby."</p>

<p>"Ah, no; that vile dragoon seat, with your long stirrup, and
your heel<br>
dropped, and your elbow this way, and your head that! How could
you ever<br>
screw your horse up to his fence, lifting him along as you came
up through<br>
the heavy ground, and with a stroke of your hand sending him pop
over, with<br>
his hind-legs well under him?" Here she burst into a fit of
laughter at my<br>
look of amazement, as with voice, gesture, and look she actually
dramatized<br>
the scene she described.</p>

<p>By the time that I had costumed my fair friend in my dragoon
cloak and a<br>
foraging cap, with a gold band around it, which was the extent of
muffling<br>
my establishment could muster, a distant noise without apprised
us that the<br>
phaeton was approaching. Certainly, the mode in which that
equipage came<br>
up to the door might have inspired sentiments of fear in any
heart less<br>
steeled against danger than my fair cousin's. The two blood
chestnuts (for<br>
it was those Mike harnessed, having a groom's dislike to take a
racer out<br>
of training) were surrounded by about twenty people: some at
their heads;<br>
some patting them on the flanks; some spoking the wheels; and a
few, the<br>
more cautious of the party, standing at a respectable distance
and offering<br>
advice. The mode of progression was simply a spring, a plunge, a
rear,<br>
a lounge, and a kick; and considering it was the first time they
ever<br>
performed together, nothing could be more uniform than their
display.<br>
Sometimes the pole would be seen to point straight upward, like a
lightning<br>
conductor, while the infuriated animals appeared sparring with
their<br>
fore-legs at an imaginary enemy. Sometimes, like the pictures in
a<br>
school-book on mythology, they would seem in the act of diving,
while<br>
with their hind-legs they dashed the splash-board into fragments
behind<br>
them,&mdash;their eyes flashing fire, their nostrils distended, their
flanks<br>
heaving, and every limb trembling with passion and
excitement.</p>

<p>"That's what I call a rare turn-out," said Baby, who enjoyed
the proceeding<br>
amazingly.</p>

<p>"Yes; but remember," said I, "we're not to have all these
running footmen<br>
the whole way."</p>

<p>"I like that near-sider with the white fetlock."</p>

<p>"You're right, Miss," said Mike, who entered at the moment,
and felt quite<br>
gratified at the criticism,&mdash;"you're right, Miss; it's himself
can do it."</p>

<p>"Come, Baby, are you ready?"</p>

<p>"All right, sir," said she, touching her cap knowingly with
her forefinger.</p>

<p>"Will the tackle hold, Mike?" said I.</p>

<p>"We'll take this with us, at any rate," pointing, as he spoke,
to a<br>
considerable coil of rope, a hammer, and a basket of nails, he
carried on<br>
his arm. "It's the break harness we have, and it ought to be
strong enough;<br>
but sure if the thunder comes on again, they'd smash a chain
cable."</p>

<p>"Now, Charley," cried Baby, "keep their heads straight; for
when they go<br>
that way, they mean going."</p>

<p>"Well, Baby, let's start; but pray remember one thing,&mdash;if I'm
not as<br>
agreeable on the journey as I ought to be, if I don't say as many
pretty<br>
things to my pretty coz, it's because these confounded beasts
will give me<br>
as much as I can do."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, look after the cattle, and take another time for
squeezing my<br>
hand. I say, Charley, you'd like to smoke, now, wouldn't you? If
so, don't<br>
mind me."</p>

<p>"A thousand thanks for thinking of it; but I'll not commit
such a trespass<br>
on good breeding."</p>

<p>When we reached the door, the prospect looked dark and dismal
enough. The<br>
rain had almost ceased, but masses of black clouds were hurrying
across<br>
the sky, and the low rumbling noise of a gathering storm crept
along the<br>
ground. Our panting equipage, with its two mounted grooms
behind,&mdash;for to<br>
provide against all accident, Mike ordered two such to follow
us,&mdash;stood<br>
in waiting. Miss Blake's horse, held by the smallest imaginable
bit of<br>
boyhood, bringing up the rear.</p>

<p>"Look at Paddy Byrne's face," said Baby, directing my
attention to the<br>
little individual in question.</p>

<p>Now, small as the aforesaid face was, it contrived, within its
limits, to<br>
exhibit an expression of unqualified fear. I had no time,
however, to give<br>
a second look, when I jumped into the phaeton and seized the
reins. Mike<br>
sprang up behind at a look from me, and without speaking a word,
the<br>
stablemen and helpers flew right and left. The chestnuts, seeing
all free<br>
before them, made one tremendous plunge, carrying the
fore-carriage clear<br>
off the ground, and straining every nut, bolt, screw, and strap
about us<br>
with the effort.</p>

<p>"They're off now," cried Mickey.</p>

<p>"Yes, they are off now," said Baby. "Keep them going."</p>

<p>Nothing could be easier to follow than this advice; and in
fact so little<br>
merit had I in obeying it, that I never spoke a word. Down the
avenue we<br>
went, at the speed of lightning, the stones and the water from
the late<br>
rain flying and splashing about us. In one series of plunges,
agreeably<br>
diversified by a strong bang upon the splash-board, we reached
the gate.<br>
Before I had time to utter a prayer for our safety, we were
through and<br>
fairly upon the high road.</p>

<p>"Musha, but the master's mad!" cried the old dame of the
gate-lodge; "he<br>
wasn't out of this gate for a year and a half, and look
now&mdash;"</p>

<p>The rest was lost in the clear ringing laugh of Baby, who
clapped her hands<br>
in ecstasy and delight.</p>

<p>"What a spanking pair they are! I suppose you wouldn't let me
get my hand<br>
on them?" said she, making a gesture as if to take the reins.</p>

<p>"Heaven forbid, my dear!" said I; "they've nearly pulled my
wrists off<br>
already."</p>

<p>Our road, like many in the west of Ireland, lay through a
level tract of<br>
bog; deep ditches, half filled with water, on either side of us,
but,<br>
fortunately, neither hill nor valley for several miles.</p>

<p>"There's the mail," said Baby, pointing to a dark speck at a
long distance<br>
off.</p>

<p>Ere many minutes elapsed, our stretching gallop, for such had
our pace<br>
sobered into, brought us up with it, and as we flew by, at top
speed, Baby<br>
jumped to her feet, and turning a waggish look at our beaten
rivals, burst<br>
out into a fit of triumphant laughter.</p>

<p>Mike was correct as to time; in some few seconds less than
forty minutes we<br>
turned into the avenue of Gurt-na-Morra. Tearing along like the
very moment<br>
of their starting, the hot and fiery animals galloped up the
approach, and<br>
at length came to a stop in a deep ploughed field, into which,
fortunately<br>
for us, Mr. Blake, animated less by the picturesque than the
profitable,<br>
had converted his green lawn. This check, however, was less owing
to my<br>
agency than to that of my servants; for dismounting in haste,
they flew to<br>
the horses' heads, and with ready tact, and before I had helped
my cousin<br>
to the ground, succeeded in unharnessing them from the carriage,
and led<br>
them, blown and panting, covered with foam, and splashed with
mud, into the<br>
space before the door.</p>

<p>By this time we were joined by the whole Blake family, who
poured forth in<br>
astonishment at our strange and sudden appearance. Explanation on
my part<br>
was unnecessary, for Baby, with a volubility quite her own, gave
the whole<br>
recital in less than three minutes. From the moment of her advent
to her<br>
departure, they had it all; and while she mingled her ridicule at
my<br>
surprise, her praise of my luncheon, her jests at my prudence,
the whole<br>
family joined heartily in her mirth, while they welcomed, with
most<br>
unequivocal warmth, my first visit to Gurt-na-Morra.</p>

<p>I confess it was with no slight gratification I remarked that
Baby's visit<br>
was as much a matter of surprise to them as to me. Believing her
to have<br>
gone to visit at Portumna Castle, they felt no uneasiness at her
absence;<br>
so that, in her descent upon me, she was really only guided by
her own<br>
wilful fancy, and that total absence of all consciousness of
wrong which<br>
makes a truly innocent girl the hardiest of all God's creatures.
I was<br>
reassured by this feeling, and satisfied that, whatever the
intentions of<br>
the elder members of the Blake family, Baby was, at least, no
participator<br>
in their plots or sharer in their intrigues.</p>

<br><br><br><br><p>CHAPTER XLVI.</p>

<p>NEW VIEWS.</p>

<p>When I found myself the next morning at home, I could not help
ruminating<br>
over the strange adventures of the preceding day, and felt a kind
of<br>
self-reproach at the frigid manner in which I had hitherto
treated all the<br>
Blake advances, contrasting so ill for me with the unaffected
warmth and<br>
kind good-nature of their reception. Never alluding, even by
accident, to<br>
my late estrangement; never, by a chance speech, indicating that
they<br>
felt any soreness for the past,&mdash;they talked away about the
gossip of<br>
the country: its feuds, its dinners, its assizes, its balls,
its<br>
garrisons,&mdash;all the varied subjects of country life were gayly
and<br>
laughingly discussed; and when, as I entered my own silent and
deserted<br>
home, and contrasted its look of melancholy and gloom with the
gay and<br>
merry scene I so lately parted from, when my echoing steps
reverberated<br>
along the flagged hall,&mdash;I thought of the happy family picture I
left<br>
behind me, and could not help avowing to myself that the goods of
fortune<br>
I possessed were but ill dispensed, when, in the midst of every
means and<br>
appliance for comfort and happiness, I lived a solitary man,
companionless<br>
and alone.</p>

<p>I arose from breakfast a hundred times,&mdash;now walking
impatiently towards<br>
the window, now strolling into the drawing-room. Around, on every
side, lay<br>
scattered the prints and drawings, as Baby had thrown them
carelessly<br>
upon the floor; her handkerchief was also there. I took it up; I
know not<br>
why,&mdash;some lurking leaven of old romance perhaps suggested
it,&mdash;but I hoped<br>
it might prove of delicate texture, and bespeaking that lady-like
coquetry<br>
which so pleasantly associates with the sex in our minds. Alas,
no! Nothing<br>
could be more palpably the opposite: torn, and with a knot&mdash;some
hint to<br>
memory&mdash;upon one corner, it was no aid to my careering fancy. And
yet&mdash;and<br>
yet, what a handsome girl she is; how finely, how delicately
formed that<br>
Greek outline of forehead and brow; how transparently soft that
downy pink<br>
upon her cheek! With what varied expression those eyes can
beam!&mdash;ay, that<br>
they can: but, confound it, there's this fault, their very
archness, their<br>
sly malice, will be interpreted by the ill-judging world to any
but the<br>
real motive. "How like a flirt!" will one say. "How impertinent!
How<br>
ill-bred!" The conventional stare of cold, patched, and painted
beauty,<br>
upon whose unblushing cheek no stray tinge of modesty has
wandered, will be<br>
tolerated, even admired; while the artless beamings of the soul
upon the<br>
face of rural loveliness will be condemned without appeal.</p>

<p>Such a girl may a man marry who destines his days to the wild
west; but woe<br>
unto him!&mdash;woe unto him, should he migrate among the more
civilized and<br>
less charitable <i>coteries</i> of our neighbors!</p>

<p>"Ah, here are the papers, and I was forgetting. Let me
see&mdash;'Bayonne'&mdash;ay,<br>
'march of the troops&mdash;Sixth Corps.' What can that be without? I
say, Mike,<br>
who is cantering along the avenue?"</p>

<p>"It's me, sir. I'm training the brown filly for Miss Mary, as
your honor<br>
bid me last night."</p>

<p>"Ah, very true. Does she go quietly?"</p>

<p>"Like a lamb, sir; barrin' she does give a kick now and then
at the sheet,<br>
when it bangs against her legs."</p>

<p>"Am I to go over with the books now, sir?" said a wild-looking
shockhead<br>
appearing within the door.</p>

<p>"Yes, take them over, with my compliments; and say I hope Miss
Mary Blake<br>
has caught no cold."</p>

<p>"You were speaking about a habit and hat, sir?" said Mrs.
Magra, curtsying<br>
as she entered.</p>

<p>"Yes, Mrs. Magra; I want your advice. Oh, tell Barnes I really
cannot be<br>
bored about those eternal turnips every day of my life. And,
Mike, I wish<br>
you'd make them look over the four-horse harness. I want to try
those<br>
grays; they tell me they'll run well together. Well, Freney,
more<br>
complaints, I hope? Nothing but trespasses! I don't care, so
you'd not<br>
worry me, if they eat up every blade of clover in the grounds;
I'm sick<br>
of being bored this way. Did you say that we'd eight couple of
good<br>
dogs?&mdash;quite enough to begin with. Tell Jones to ride into
Banagher and<br>
look after that box; Buckmaster sent it from London two months
ago, and it<br>
has been lying there ever since. And, Mrs. Magra, pray let the
windows be<br>
opened, and the house well aired; that drawing-room would be all
the better<br>
for new papering."</p>

<p>These few and broken directions may serve to show my
readers&mdash;what<br>
certainly they failed to convince myself of&mdash;that a new chapter
of my life<br>
had opened before me; and that, in proportion to the length of
time<br>
my feelings had found neither vent nor outlet, they now rushed
madly,<br>
tempestuously into their new channels, suffering no impediment to
arrest,<br>
no obstacle to oppose their current.</p>

<p>Nothing can be conceived more opposite to my late, than my
present habits<br>
now became. The house, the grounds, the gardens, all seemed to
participate<br>
in the new influence which beamed upon myself; the stir and
bustle of<br>
active life was everywhere perceptible; and amidst numerous
preparations<br>
for the moors and the hunting-field, for pleasure parties upon
the river,<br>
and fishing excursions up the mountains, my days were spent. The
Blakes,<br>
without even for a moment pressing their attentions upon me,
permitted me<br>
to go and come among them unquestioned and unasked. When, nearly
every<br>
morning, I appeared in the breakfast-room, I felt exactly like a
member of<br>
the family; the hundred little discrepancies of thought and habit
which<br>
struck me forcibly at first, looked daily less apparent; the
careless<br>
inattentions of my fair cousins as to dress, their free-and-easy
boisterous<br>
manner, their very accents, which fell so harshly on my ear,
gradually made<br>
less and less impression, until at last, when a raw English
Ensign, just<br>
arrived in the neighborhood, remarked to me in confidence, "What
devilish<br>
fine girls they were, if they were not so confoundedly Irish!" I
could not<br>
help wondering what the fellow meant, and attributed the
observation more<br>
to his ignorance than to its truth.</p>

<p>Papa and Mamma Blake, like prudent generals, so long as they
saw the forces<br>
of the enemy daily wasting before them; so long as they could
with impunity<br>
carry on the war at his expense,&mdash;resolved to risk nothing by a
pitched<br>
battle. Unlike the Dalrymples, they could leave all to time.</p>

<p>Oh, tell me not of dark eyes swimming in their own ethereal
essence;<br>
tell me not of pouting lips, of glossy ringlets, of taper
fingers, and<br>
well-rounded insteps; speak not to me of soft voices, whose
seductive<br>
sounds ring sweetly in our hearts; preach not of those thousand
womanly<br>
graces so dear to every man, and doubly to him who lives apart
from all<br>
their influences and their fascinations; neither dwell upon
congenial<br>
temperament, similarity of taste, of disposition, and of thought;
these are<br>
not the great risks a man runs in life. Of all the temptations,
strong as<br>
these may be, there is one greater than them all, and that is,
propinquity!</p>

<p>Show me the man who has ever stood this test; show me the man,
deserving<br>
the name of such, who has become daily and hourly exposed to the
breaching<br>
artillery of flashing eyes, of soft voices, of winning smiles,
and kind<br>
speeches, and who hasn't felt, and that too soon too, a breach
within<br>
the rampart of his heart. He may, it is true,&mdash;nay, he will, in
many<br>
cases,&mdash;make a bold and vigorous defence; sometimes will he
re-intrench<br>
himself within the stockades of his prudence; but, alas! it is
only to<br>
defer the moment when he must lay down his arms. He may, like a
wise man<br>
who sees his fate inevitable, make a virtue of necessity, and
surrender at<br>
discretion; or, like a crafty foe, seeing his doom before him,
under the<br>
cover of the night he may make a sortie from the garrison, and
run for his<br>
life. Ignominious as such a course must be, it is often the only
one left.</p>

<p>But to come back. Love, like the small-pox, is most dangerous
when you take<br>
it in the natural way. Those made matches, which Heaven is
supposed to<br>
have a hand in, when placing an unmarried gentleman's property in
the<br>
neighborhood of an unmarried lady's, which destine two people for
each<br>
other in life, because their well-judging friends have agreed,
"They'll do<br>
very well; they were made for each other,"&mdash;these are the mild
cases of the<br>
malady. This process of friendly vaccination takes out the poison
of the<br>
disease, substituting a more harmless and less exciting
affection; but the<br>
really dangerous instances are those from contact, that same
propinquity,<br>
that confounded tendency every man yields to, to fall into a
railroad of<br>
habit; that is the risk, that is the danger. What a bore it is to
find that<br>
the absence of one person, with whom you're in no wise in love,
will spoil<br>
your morning's canter, or your rowing party upon the river! How
much put<br>
out are you, when she, to whom you always gave your arm in to
dinner,<br>
does not make her appearance in the drawing-room; and your tea,
too, some<br>
careless one, indifferent to your taste, puts a lump of sugar too
little,<br>
or cream too much, while she&mdash;But no matter; habit has done for
you what<br>
no direct influence of beauty could do, and a slave to your own
selfish<br>
indulgences, and the cultivation of that ease you prize so
highly, you fall<br>
over head and ears in love.</p>

<p>Now, you are not, my good reader, by any means to suppose that
this was my<br>
case. No, no; I was too much what the world terms the "old
soldier" for<br>
that. To continue my illustration: like the fortress that has
been often<br>
besieged, the sentry upon the walls keeps more vigilant watch;
his ear<br>
detects the far-off clank of the dread artillery; he marks each
parallel;<br>
he notes down every breaching battery; and if he be captured, at
least it<br>
is in fair fight.</p>

<p>Such were some of my reflections as I rode slowly home one
evening from<br>
Gurt-na-Morra. Many a time, latterly, had I contrasted my own
lonely and<br>
deserted hearth with the smiling looks, the happy faces, and the
merry<br>
voices I had left behind me; and many a time did I ask myself,
"Am I never<br>
to partake of a happiness like this?" How many a man is seduced
into<br>
matrimony from this very feeling! How many a man whose hours have
passed<br>
fleetingly at the pleasant tea-table, or by the warm hearth of
some old<br>
country-house, going forth into the cold and cheerless night,
reaches his<br>
far-off home only to find it dark and gloomy, joyless and
companionless?<br>
How often has the hard-visaged look of his old butler, as, with
sleepy eyes<br>
and yawning face, he hands a bed-room candle, suggested thoughts
of married<br>
happiness? Of the perils of propinquity I have already spoken;
the risks of<br>
contrast are also great. Have you never, in strolling through
some fragrant<br>
and rich conservatory, fixed your eye upon a fair and lovely
flower, whose<br>
blossoming beauty seems to give all the lustre and all the
incense of<br>
the scene around? And how have you thought it would adorn and
grace the<br>
precincts of your home, diffusing fragrance on every side. Alas,
the<br>
experiment is not always successful. Much of the charm and many
of the<br>
fascinations which delight you are the result of association of
time and of<br>
place. The lovely voice, whose tones have spoken to your heart,
may, like<br>
some instrument, be delightful in the harmony of the orchestra,
but, after<br>
all, prove a very middling performer in a duet.</p>

<p>I say not this to deter men from matrimony, but to warn them
from a<br>
miscalculation which may mar their happiness. Flirtation is a
very fine<br>
thing, but it's only a state of transition after all. The tadpole
existence<br>
of the lover would be great fun, if one was never to become a
frog under<br>
the hands of the parson. I say all this dispassionately and
advisedly. Like<br>
the poet of my country, for many years of my life,&mdash;</p>

<p>    "My only books were woman's looks,"</p>

<p>and certainly I subscribe to a circulating library.</p>

<p>All this long digression may perhaps bring the reader to where
it brought<br>
me,&mdash;the very palpable conviction, that, though not in love with
my cousin<br>
Baby, I could not tell when I might eventually become so.</p>

<br><br><br><br><p>CHAPTER XLVII.</p>

<p>A RECOGNITION.</p>

<p>The most pleasing part about retrospect is the memory of our
bygone hopes.<br>
The past, however happy, however blissful, few would wish to live
over<br>
again; but who is there that does not long for, does not pine
after the<br>
day-dream which gilded the future, which looked ever forward to
the time to<br>
come as to a realization of all that was dear to us, lightening
our present<br>
cares, soothing our passing sorrows by that one thought?</p>

<p>Life is marked out in periods in which, like stages in a
journey, we rest<br>
and repose ourselves, casting a look, now back upon the road we
have been<br>
travelling, now throwing a keener glance towards the path left
us. It is at<br>
such spots as these remembrance comes full upon us, and that we
feel how<br>
little our intentions have swayed our career or influenced our
actions;<br>
the aspirations, the resolves of youth, are either looked upon as
puerile<br>
follies, or a most distant day settled on for their realization.
The<br>
principles we fondly looked to, like our guide-stars, are dimly
visible,<br>
not seen; the friends we cherished are changed and gone; the
scenes<br>
themselves seem no longer the sunshine and the shade we loved;
and, in<br>
fact, we are living in a new world, where our own altered
condition gives<br>
the type to all around us; the only link that binds us to the
past being<br>
that same memory that like a sad curfew tolls the twilight of our
fairest<br>
dreams and most cherished wishes.</p>

<p>That these glimpses of the bygone season of our youth should
be but fitful<br>
and passing&mdash;tinging, not coloring the landscape of our life&mdash;we
should be<br>
engaged in all the active bustle and turmoil of the world,
surrounded by<br>
objects of hope, love, and ambition, stemming the strong tide in
whose<br>
fountain is fortune.</p>

<p>He, however, who lives apart, a dreary and a passionless
existence, will<br>
find that in the past, more than in the future, his thoughts have
found<br>
their resting-place; memory usurps the place of hope, and he
travels<br>
through life like one walking onward; his eyes still turning
towards some<br>
loved forsaken spot, teeming with all the associations of his
happiest<br>
hours, and preserving, even in distance, the outline that he
loved.</p>

<p>Distance in time, as in space, smooths down all the
inequalities of<br>
surface; and as the cragged and rugged mountain, darkened by
cliff and<br>
precipice, shows to the far-off traveller but some blue and misty
mass,<br>
so the long-lost-sight-of hours lose all the cares and griefs
that tinged<br>
them, and to our mental eye, are but objects of uniform
loveliness and<br>
beauty; and if we do not think of</p>

<p>    "The smiles, the tears,<br>
    Of boyhood's years,"</p>

<p>it is because, like April showers, they but checker the spring
of our<br>
existence.</p>

<p>For myself, baffled in hope at a period when most men but
begin to feel it,<br>
I thought myself much older than I really was; the
disappointments of the<br>
world, like the storms of the ocean, impart a false sense of
experience to<br>
the young heart, as he sails forth upon his voyage; and it is an
easy error<br>
to mistake trials for time.</p>

<p>The goods of fortune by which I was surrounded, took nothing
from the<br>
bitterness of my retrospect; on the contrary, I could not help
feeling that<br>
every luxury of my life was bought by my surrender of that career
which had<br>
elated me in my own esteem, and which, setting a high and noble
ambition<br>
before me, taught me to be a man.</p>

<p>To be happy, one must not only fulfil the duties and exactions
of his<br>
station, but the station itself must answer to his views and
aspirations<br>
in life. Now, mine did not sustain this condition: all that my
life had<br>
of promise was connected with the memory of her who never could
share my<br>
fortunes; of her for whom I had earned praise and honor; becoming
ambitious<br>
as the road to her affection, only to learn after, that my hopes
were but a<br>
dream, and my paradise a wilderness.</p>

<p>While thus the inglorious current of my life ran on, I was not
indifferent<br>
to the mighty events the great continent of Europe was
witnessing. The<br>
successes of the Peninsular campaign; the triumphant entry of
the<br>
British into France; the downfall of Napoleon; the restoration of
the<br>
Bourbons,&mdash;followed each other with the rapidity of the most
common-place<br>
occurrences; and in the few short years in which I had sprung
from boyhood<br>
to man's estate, the whole condition of the world was altered.
Kings<br>
deposed; great armies disbanded; rightful sovereigns restored to
their<br>
dominions; banished and exiled men returned to their country,
invested with<br>
rank and riches; and peace, in the fullest tide of its blessings,
poured<br>
down upon the earth devastated and blood-stained.</p>

<p>Years passed on; and between the careless abandonment to the
mere amusement<br>
of the hour, and the darker meditation upon the past, time
slipped away.<br>
From my old friends and brother officers I heard but rarely.
Power, who at<br>
first wrote frequently, grew gradually less and less
communicative. Webber,<br>
who had gone to Paris at the peace, had written but one letter;
while, from<br>
the rest, a few straggling lines were all I received. In truth be
it told,<br>
my own negligence and inability to reply cost me this apparent
neglect.</p>

<p>It was a fine evening in May, when, rigging up a sprit-sail, I
jumped into<br>
my yawl, and dropped easily down the river. The light wind gently
curled<br>
the crested water, the trees waved gently and shook their
branches in the<br>
breeze, and my little barque, bending slightly beneath, rustled
on her<br>
foamy track with that joyous bounding motion so inspiriting to
one's<br>
heart. The clouds were flying swiftly past, tinging with their
shadows the<br>
mountains beneath; the Munster shore, glowing with a rich
sunlight, showed<br>
every sheep-cot and every hedge-row clearly out, while the deep
shadow of<br>
tall Scariff darkened the silent river where Holy Island, with
its ruined<br>
churches and melancholy tower, was reflected in the still
water.</p>

<p>It was a thoroughly Irish landscape: the changeful sky; the
fast-flitting<br>
shadows; the brilliant sunlight; the plenteous fields; the broad
and<br>
swelling stream; the dark mountain, from whose brown crest a
wreath of thin<br>
blue smoke was rising,&mdash;were all there smiling yet sadly, like
her own<br>
sons, across whose lowering brow some fitful flash of fancy ever
playing<br>
dallies like sunbeams on a darkening stream, nor marks the depth
that lies<br>
below.</p>

<p>I sat musing over the strange harmony of Nature with the
temperament of<br>
man, every phase of his passionate existence seeming to have its
type in<br>
things inanimate, when a loud cheer from the land aroused me, and
the<br>
words, "Charley! Cousin Charley!" came wafted over the water to
where<br>
I lay. For some time I could but distinguish the faint outline of
some<br>
figures on the shore; but as I came nearer, I recognized my fair
cousin<br>
Baby, who, with a younger brother of some eight or nine years
old, was<br>
taking an evening walk.</p>

<p>"Do you know, Charley," said she, "the boys have gone over to
the castle to<br>
look for you; we want you particularly this evening."</p>

<p>"Indeed, Cousin Baby! Well, I fear you must make my
excuses."</p>

<p>"Then, once for all, I will not. I know this is one of your
sulky moods,<br>
and I tell you frankly I'll not put up with them any more."</p>

<p>"No, no, Baby, not so; out of spirits if you will, but not out
of temper."</p>

<p>"The distinction is much too fine for me, if there be any. But
there now,<br>
do be a good fellow; come up with us&mdash;come up with me!"</p>

<p>As she said this she placed her arm within mine. I thought,
too,&mdash;perhaps<br>
it was but a thought,&mdash;she pressed me gently. I know she blushed
and turned<br>
away her head to hide it.</p>

<p>"I don't pretend to be proof to your entreaty, Cousin Baby,"
said I, with<br>
half-affected gallantry, putting her fingers to my lips.</p>

<p>"There, how can you be so foolish; look at William yonder; I
am sure he<br>
must have seen you!" But William, God bless him! was
bird's-nesting or<br>
butterfly-hunting or daisy-picking or something of that kind.</p>

<p>O ye young brothers, who, sufficiently old to be deemed
companions and<br>
<i>chaperons</i>, but yet young enough to be regarded as having
neither eyes nor<br>
ears, what mischief have ye to answer for; what a long reckoning
of tender<br>
speeches, of soft looks, of pressed hands, lies at your door!
What an<br>
incentive to flirtation is the wily imp who turns ever and anon
from his<br>
careless gambols to throw his laughter-loving eyes upon you,
calling up the<br>
mantling blush to both your cheeks! He seems to chronicle the
hours of your<br>
dalliance, making your secrets known unto each other. We have
gone through<br>
our share of flirtation in this life: match-making mothers,
prying aunts,<br>
choleric uncles, benevolent and open-hearted fathers, we
understand to the<br>
life, and care no more for such man-traps than a Melton man, well
mounted<br>
on his strong-boned thorough-bred, does for a four-barred
ox-fence that<br>
lies before him. Like him, we take them flying; never relaxing
the slapping<br>
stride of our loose gallop, we go straight ahead, never turning
aside,<br>
except for a laugh at those who flounder in the swamps we sneer
at. But we<br>
confess honestly, we fear the little, brother, the small urchin
who, with<br>
nankeen trousers and three rows of buttons, performs the part of
Cupid. He<br>
strikes real terror into our heart; he it is who, with a cunning
wink or<br>
sly smile, seems to confirm the soft nonsense we are weaving; by
some<br>
slight gesture he seems to check off the long reckoning of our
attentions,<br>
bringing us every moment nearer to the time when the score must
be settled<br>
and the debt paid. He it is who, by a memory delightfully
oblivious of<br>
his task and his table-book, is tenacious to the life of what you
said<br>
to Fanny; how you put your head under Lucy's bonnet; he can
imitate to<br>
perfection the way you kneeled upon the grass; and the wretch has
learned<br>
to smack his lips like a <i>gourmand</i>, that he, may convey another
stage of<br>
your proceeding.</p>

<p>Oh, for infant schools for everything under the age of ten!
Oh, for<br>
factories for the children of the rich! The age of prying
curiosity is from<br>
four-and-a-half to nine, and Fonch&eacute; himself might get a
lesson in <i>police</i><br>
from an urchin in his alphabet.</p>

<p>I contrived soon, however, to forget the presence of even the
little<br>
brother. The night was falling; Baby appeared getting fatigued
with her<br>
walk, for she leaned somewhat more heavily upon my arm, and I&mdash;I
cannot<br>
tell wherefore&mdash;fell into that train of thinking aloud, which
somehow, upon<br>
a summer's eve, with a fair girl beside one, is the very nearest
thing to<br>
love-making.</p>

<p>"There, Charley, don't now&mdash;ah, don't! Do let go my hand; they
are coming<br>
down the avenue."</p>

<p>I had scarcely time to obey the injunction, when Mr. Blake
called out:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Well, indeed! Charley, this is really fortunate; we have got
a friend to<br>
take tea with us, and wanted you to meet him."</p>

<p>Muttering an internal prayer for something not exactly the
welfare of the<br>
aforesaid friend, whom I judged to be some Galway squire, I
professed aloud<br>
the pleasure I felt in having come in so opportunely.</p>

<p>"He wishes particularly to make your acquaintance."</p>

<p>"So much the worse," thought I to myself; "it rarely happens
that this<br>
feeling is mutual."</p>

<p>Evidently provoked at the little curiosity I exhibited, Blake
added,&mdash;</p>

<p>"He's on his way to Fermoy with a detachment."</p>

<p>"Indeed! what regiment, pray?"</p>

<p>"The 28th Foot."</p>

<p>"Ah, I don't know them."</p>

<p>By this time we reached the steps of the hall-door, and just
as we did so,<br>
the door opened suddenly, and a tall figure in uniform presented
himself.<br>
With one spring he seized my hand and nearly wrung it off.</p>

<p>"Why what," said I, "can this be? Is it really&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Sparks," said he,&mdash;"your old friend Sparks, my boy; I've
changed into the<br>
infantry, and here I am. Heard by chance you were in the
neighborhood; met<br>
Mr. Blake, your friend here, at the inn, and accepted his
invitation to<br>
meet you."</p>

<p>Poor Sparks, albeit the difference in his costume, was the
same as ever.<br>
Having left the Fourteenth soon after I quitted them, he knew but
little of<br>
their fortunes; and he himself had been on recruiting stations
nearly the<br>
whole time since we had met before.</p>

<p>While we each continued to extol the good fortune of the
other,&mdash;he mine as<br>
being no longer in the service, and I his for still being so,&mdash;we
learned<br>
the various changes which had happened to each of us during our
separation.<br>
Although his destination was ultimately Fermoy, Portumua was
ordered to<br>
be his present quarter; and I felt delighted to have once more an
old<br>
companion within reach, to chat over former days of campaigning
and nights<br>
of merriment in the Peninsula.</p>

<p>Sparks soon became a constant visitor and guest at
Gurt-na-Morra; his good<br>
temper, his easy habits, his simplicity of character, rapidly
enabled him<br>
to fall into all their ways; and although evidently not what Baby
would<br>
call "the man for Galway," he endeavored with all his might to
please every<br>
one, and certainly succeeded to a considerable extent.</p>

<p>Baby alone seemed to take pleasure in tormenting the poor sub.
Long before<br>
she met with him having heard much from me of his exploits
abroad, she was<br>
continually bringing up some anecdote of his unhappy loves or
mis-placed<br>
passions; which he evidently smarted under the more, from the
circumstance<br>
that he appeared rather inclined to like my fair cousin.</p>

<p>As she continued this for some time, I remarked that Sparks,
who at<br>
first was all gayety and high spirits, grew gradually more
depressed and<br>
dispirited. I became convinced that the poor fellow was in love;
very<br>
little management on my part was necessary to obtain his
confession; and<br>
accordingly, the same evening the thought first struck me, as we
were<br>
riding slowly home towards O'Malley Castle, I touched at first
generally<br>
upon the merits of the Blakes, their hospitality, etc., then
diverged to<br>
the accomplishments and perfections of the girls, and lastly,
Baby herself,<br>
in all form, came up for sentence.</p>

<p>"Ah, yes!" said Sparks, with a deep sigh, "it is quite as you
say; she is a<br>
lovely girl; and that liveliness in her character, that
elasticity in her<br>
temperament, chastened down as it might be, by the feeling of
respect for<br>
the man she loved! I say, Charley, is it a very long attachment
of yours?"</p>

<p>"A long attachment of mine! Why, my dear Sparks, you can't
suppose that<br>
there is anything between us! I pledge you my word most
faithfully."</p>

<p>"Oh, no, don't tell me that; what good can there be in
mystifying me?"</p>

<p>"I have no such intention, believe me. My cousin Baby, however
I like and<br>
admire her, has no other place in my affection than a very
charming girl<br>
who has lightened a great many dreary and tiresome hours, and
made my<br>
banishment from the world less irksome than I should have found
it without<br>
her."</p>

<p>"And you are really not in love?"</p>

<p>"Not a bit of it!"</p>

<p>"Nor going to marry her either?"</p>

<p>"Not the least notion of it!&mdash;a fact. Baby and I are excellent
friends, for<br>
the very reason that we were never lovers; we have had no <i>petits
jeux</i><br>
of fallings out and makings up; no hide-and-seek trials of
affected<br>
indifference and real disappointments; no secrets, no griefs, nor
grudges;<br>
neither quarrels nor keepsakes. In fact, we are capital cousins;
quizzing<br>
every one for our own amusement; riding, walking, boating
together; in<br>
fact, doing and thinking of everything save sighs and
declarations; always<br>
happy to meet, and never broken-hearted when we parted. And I can
only add,<br>
as a proof of my sincerity, that if you feel as I suspect you do
from your<br>
questions, I'll be your ambassador to the court of Gurt-na-Morra
with<br>
sincere pleasure."</p>

<p>"Will you really? Will you, indeed, Charley, do this for me?
Will you<br>
strengthen my wishes by your aid, and give me all your influence
with the<br>
family?"</p>

<p>I could scarcely help smiling at poor Sparks's eagerness, or
the<br>
unwarrantable value he put upon my alliance, in a case where his
own<br>
unassisted efforts did not threaten much failure.</p>

<p>"I repeat it, Sparks, I'll make a proposal for you in all
form, aided and<br>
abetted by everything recommendatory and laudatory I can think
of; I'll<br>
talk of you as a Peninsular of no small note and promise; and
observe rigid<br>
silence about your Welsh flirtation and your Spanish
elopement."</p>

<p>"You'll not blab about the Dalrymples, I hope?"</p>

<p>"Trust me; I only hope you will be always equally discreet:
but now&mdash;when<br>
shall it be? Should you like to consider the matter more?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no, nothing of the kind; let it be to-morrow, at once, if
I am to<br>
fail; even that&mdash;anything's better than suspense."</p>

<p>"Well, then, to-morrow be it," said I.</p>

<p>So I wished him a good-night, and a stout heart to hear his
fortune withal.</p>

<br><br><br><br><p>CHAPTER XLVIII.</p>

<p>A MISTAKE.</p>

<p>I ordered my horses at an early hour; and long before
Sparks&mdash;lover that<br>
he was&mdash;had opened his eyes to the light, was already on my way
towards<br>
Gurt-na-Morra. Several miles slipped away before I well
determined how I<br>
should open my negotiations: whether to papa Blake, in the first
instance,<br>
or to madame, to whose peculiar province these secrets of the
home<br>
department belonged; or why not at once to Baby?&mdash;because, after
all, with<br>
her it rested finally to accept or refuse. To address myself to
the heads<br>
of the department seemed the more formal course; and as I was
acting<br>
entirely as an "envoy extraordinary," I deemed this the fitting
mode of<br>
proceeding.</p>

<p>It was exactly eight o'clock as I drove up to the door. Mr.
Blake was<br>
standing at the open window of the breakfast-room, sniffing the
fresh air<br>
of the morning. The Blake mother was busily engaged with the
economy of the<br>
tea-table; a very simple style of morning costume, and a nightcap
with a<br>
flounce like a petticoat, marking her unaffected toilet. Above
stairs, more<br>
than one head <i>en papillate</i> took a furtive peep between the
curtains; and<br>
the butler of the family, in corduroys and a fur cap, was weeding
turnips<br>
in the lawn before the door.</p>

<p>Mrs. Blake had barely time to take a hurried departure, when
her husband<br>
came out upon the steps to bid me welcome. There is no
physiognomist like<br>
your father of a family, or your mother with marriageable
daughters.<br>
Lavater was nothing to them, in reading the secret springs of
action, the<br>
hidden sources of all character. Had there been a good
respectable bump<br>
allotted by Spurzheim to "honorable intentions," the matter had
been<br>
all fair and easy,&mdash;the very first salute of the gentleman would
have<br>
pronounced upon his views. But, alas! no such guide is
forthcoming; and the<br>
science, as it now exists, is enveloped in doubt and difficulty.
The gay,<br>
laughing temperament of some, the dark and serious composure of
others; the<br>
cautious and reserved, the open and the candid, the witty, the
sententious,<br>
the clever, the dull, the prudent, the reckless,&mdash;in a word,
every variety<br>
which the innumerable hues of character imprint upon the human
face divine<br>
are their study. Their convictions are the slow and patient
fruits of<br>
intense observation and great logical accuracy. Carefully noting
down<br>
every lineament and feature,&mdash;their change, their action, and
their<br>
development,&mdash;they track a lurking motive with the scent of a
bloodhound,<br>
and run down a growing passion with an unrelenting speed. I have
been<br>
in the witness-box, exposed to the licensed badgering and
privileged<br>
impertinence of a lawyer, winked, leered, frowned, and sneered at
with all<br>
the long-practised tact of a <i>nisi prius</i> torturer; I have stood
before the<br>
cold, fish-like, but searching eye of a prefect of police, as he
compared<br>
my passport with my person, and thought he could detect a
discrepancy in<br>
both,&mdash;but I never felt the same sense of total exposure as when
glanced at<br>
by the half-cautious, half-prying look of a worthy father or
mother, in a<br>
family where there are daughters to marry, and "nobody coming to
woo."</p>

<p>"You're early, Charley," said Mr. Blake, with an affected
mixture of<br>
carelessness and warmth. "You have not had breakfast?"</p>

<p>"No, sir. I have come to claim a part of yours; and if I
mistake not, you<br>
seem a little later than usual."</p>

<p>"Not more than a few minutes. The girls will be down
presently; they're<br>
early risers, Charley; good habits are just as easy as bad ones;
and, the<br>
Lord be praised! my girls were never brought up with any
other."</p>

<p>"I am well aware of it, sir; and indeed, if I may be permitted
to take<br>
advantage of the <i>apropos</i>, it was on the subject of one of your
daughters<br>
that I wished to speak to you this morning, and which brought me
over at<br>
this uncivilized hour, hoping to find you alone."</p>

<p>Mr. Blake's look for a moment was one of triumphant
satisfaction; it was<br>
but a glance, however, and repressed the very instant after, as
he said,<br>
with a well got-up indifference,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Just step with me into the study, and we're sure not to be
interrupted."</p>

<p>Now, although I have little time or space for such dallying, I
cannot help<br>
dwelling for a moment upon the aspect of what Mr. Blake dignified
with the<br>
name of his study. It was a small apartment with one window, the
panes of<br>
which, independent of all aid from a curtain, tempered the
daylight through<br>
the medium of cobwebs, dust, and the ill-trained branches of some
wall-tree<br>
without.</p>

<p>Three oak chairs and a small table were the only articles of
furniture,<br>
while around, on all sides, lay the <i>disjecta membra</i> of Mr.
Blake's<br>
hunting, fishing, shooting, and coursing equipments,&mdash;old
top-boots,<br>
driving whips, odd spurs, a racing saddle, a blunderbuss, the
helmet of the<br>
Galway Light Horse, a salmon net, a large map of the county with
a marginal<br>
index to several mortgages marked with a cross, a stable lantern,
the<br>
rudder of a boat, and several other articles representative of
his daily<br>
associations; but not one book, save an odd volume of Watty
Cox's<br>
Magazine, whose pages seemed as much the receptacle of brown
hackles for<br>
trout-fishing as the resource of literary leisure.</p>

<p>"Here we'll be quite cosey, and to ourselves," said Mr. Blake,
as, placing<br>
a chair for me, he sat down himself, with the air of a man
resolved to<br>
assist, by advice and counsel, the dilemma of some dear
friend.</p>

<p>After a few preliminary observations, which, like a breathing
canter before<br>
a race, serves to get your courage up, and settle you well in
your seat,<br>
I opened my negotiation by some very broad and sweeping truisms
about the<br>
misfortunes of a bachelor existence, the discomforts of his
position,<br>
his want of home and happiness, the necessity for his one day
thinking<br>
seriously about marriage; it being in a measure almost as
inevitable<br>
a termination of the free-and-easy career of his single life
as<br>
transportation for seven years is to that of a poacher. "You
cannot go on,<br>
sir," said I, "trespassing forever upon your neighbors'
preserves; you must<br>
be apprehended sooner or later; therefore, I think, the better
way is to<br>
take out a license."</p>

<p>Never was a small sally of wit more thoroughly successful. Mr.
Blake<br>
laughed till he cried, and when he had done, wiped his eyes with
a snuffy<br>
handkerchief, and cried till he laughed again. As, somehow, I
could not<br>
conceal from myself a suspicion as to the sincerity of my
friend's mirth,<br>
I merely consoled myself with the French adage, that "he laughs
best who<br>
laughs last;" and went on:&mdash;</p>

<p>"It will not be deemed surprising, sir, that a man should come
to the<br>
discovery I have just mentioned much more rapidly by having
enjoyed the<br>
pleasure of intimacy with your family; not only by the example of
perfect<br>
domestic happiness presented to him, but by the prospect held out
that<br>
a heritage of the fair gifts which adorn and grace a married life
may<br>
reasonably be looked for among the daughters of those themselves
the<br>
realization of conjugal felicity."</p>

<p>Here was a canter, with a vengeance; and as I felt blown, I
slackened my<br>
pace, coughed, and resumed:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Mary Blake, sir, is, then, the object of my present
communication; she<br>
it is who has made an existence that seemed fair and pleasurable
before,<br>
appear blank and unprofitable without her. I have, therefore, to
come at<br>
once to the point, visited you this morning, formally to ask her
hand in<br>
marriage; her fortune, I may observe at once, is perfectly
immaterial, a<br>
matter of no consequence [so Mr. Blake thought also]; a
competence fully<br>
equal to every reasonable notion of expenditure&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There, there; don't, don't!" said Mr. Blake, wiping his eyes,
with a sob<br>
like a hiccough,&mdash;"don't speak of money! I know what you would
say, a<br>
handsome settlement,&mdash;a well-secured jointure, and all that. Yes,
yes, I<br>
feel it all."</p>

<p>"Why, yes, sir, I believe I may add that everything in this
respect will<br>
answer your expectations."</p>

<p>"Of course; to be sure. My poor dear Baby! How to do without
her, that's<br>
the rub! You don't know, O'Malley, what that girl is to me&mdash;you
can't know<br>
it; you'll feel it one day though&mdash;that you will!"</p>

<p>"The devil I shall!" said I to myself. "The great point is,
after all, to<br>
learn the young lady's disposition in the matter&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ah, Charley, none of this with me, you sly dog! You think I
don't know<br>
you. Why, I've been watching,&mdash;that is, I have seen&mdash;no, I mean
I've<br>
heard&mdash;They&mdash;they,&mdash;people will talk, you know."</p>

<p>"Very true, sir. But, as I was going to remark&mdash;"</p>

<p>Just at this moment the door opened, and Miss Baby herself,
looking most<br>
annoyingly handsome, put in her head.</p>

<p>"Papa, we're waiting breakfast. Ah, Charley, how d'ye do?"</p>

<p>"Come in, Baby," said Mr. Blake; "you haven't given me my kiss
this<br>
morning."</p>

<p>The lovely girl threw her arms around his neck, while her
bright and<br>
flowing locks fell richly upon his shoulder. I turned rather
sulkily away;<br>
the thing always provokes me. There is as much cold, selfish
cruelty in<br>
such <i>coram publico</i> endearments, as in the luscious display of
rich rounds<br>
and sirloins in a chop-house to the eyes of the starved and
penniless<br>
wretch without, who, with dripping rags and watering lip, eats
imaginary<br>
slices, while the pains of hunger are torturing him!</p>

<p>"There's Tim!" said Mr. Blake, suddenly. "Tim Cronin!&mdash;Tim!"
shouted he<br>
to, as it seemed to me, an imaginary individual outside; while,
in the<br>
eagerness of pursuit, he rushed out of the study, banging the
door as he<br>
went, and leaving Baby and myself to our mutual edification.</p>

<p>I should have preferred it being otherwise; but as the Fates
willed it<br>
thus, I took Baby's hand, and led her to the window. Now, there
is one<br>
feature of my countrymen which, having recognized strongly in
myself, I<br>
would fain proclaim; and writing as I do&mdash;however little people
may suspect<br>
me&mdash;solely for the sake of a moral, would gladly warn the
unsuspecting<br>
against. I mean, a very decided tendency to become the consoler,
the<br>
confidant of young ladies; seeking out opportunities of assuaging
their<br>
sorrow, reconciling their afflictions, breaking eventful passages
to<br>
their ears; not from any inherent pleasure in the tragic phases
of<br>
the intercourse, but for the semi-tenderness of manner, that
harmless<br>
hand-squeezing, that innocent waist-pressing, without which
consolation is<br>
but like salmon without lobster,&mdash;a thing maimed, wanting, and
imperfect.</p>

<p>Now, whether this with me was a natural gift, or merely a "way
we have in<br>
the army," as the song says, I shall not pretend to say; but I
venture<br>
to affirm that few men could excel me in the practice I speak of
some<br>
five-and-twenty years ago. Fair reader, do pray, if I have the
happiness<br>
of being known to you, deduct them from my age before you
subtract from my<br>
merits.</p>

<p>"Well, Baby, dear, I have just been speaking about you to
papa. Yes,<br>
dear&mdash;don't look so incredulous&mdash;even of your own sweet self.
Well, do you<br>
know, I almost prefer your hair worn that way; those same silky
masses look<br>
better falling thus heavily&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There, now, Charley! ah, don't!"</p>

<p>"Well, Baby, as I was saying, before you stopped me, I have
been asking<br>
your papa a very important question, and he has referred me to
you for the<br>
answer. And now will you tell me, in all frankness and honesty,
your mind<br>
on the matter?"</p>

<p>She grew deadly pale as I spoke these words, then suddenly
flushed up<br>
again, but said not a word. I could perceive, however, from her
heaving<br>
chest and restless manner, that no common agitation was stirring
her bosom.<br>
It was cruelty to be silent, so I continued:&mdash;</p>

<p>"One who loves you well, Baby, dear, has asked his own heart
the question,<br>
and learned that without you he has no chance of happiness; that
your<br>
bright eyes are to him bluer than the deep sky above him; that
your soft<br>
voice, your winning smile&mdash;and what a smile it is!&mdash;have taught
him that he<br>
loves, nay, adores you! Then, dearest&mdash;what pretty fingers those
are! Ah,<br>
what is this? Whence came that emerald? I never saw that ring
before,<br>
Baby!"</p>

<p>"Oh, that," said she, blushing deeply,&mdash;"that is a ring the
foolish<br>
creature Sparks gave me a couple of days ago; but I don't like
it&mdash;I don't<br>
intend to keep it."</p>

<p>So saying, she endeavored to draw it from her finger, but in
vain.</p>

<p>"But why, Baby, why take it off? Is it to give him the
pleasure of putting<br>
it on again? There, don't look angry; we must not fall out,
surely."</p>

<p>"No, Charley, if you are not vexed with me&mdash;if you are
not&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, no, my dear Baby; nothing of the kind. Sparks was quite
right in not<br>
trusting his entire fortune to my diplomacy; but at least, he
ought to have<br>
told me that he had opened the negotiation. Now, the question
simply is:<br>
Do you love him? or rather, because that shortens matters: Will
you accept<br>
him?"</p>

<p>"Love who?"</p>

<p>"Love whom? Why Sparks, to be sure!"</p>

<p>A flash of indignant surprise passed across her features, now
pale as<br>
marble; her lips were slightly parted, her large full eyes were
fixed<br>
upon me steadfastly, and her hand, which I had held in mine, she
suddenly<br>
withdrew from my grasp.</p>

<p>"And so&mdash;and so it is of Mr. Sparks's cause you are so
ardently the<br>
advocate?" she said at length, after a pause of most awkward
duration.</p>

<p>"Why, of course, my dear cousin. It was at his suit and
solicitation I<br>
called on your father; it was he himself who entreated me to take
this<br>
step; it was he&mdash;"</p>

<p>But before I could conclude, she burst into a torrent of tears
and rushed<br>
from the room.</p>

<p>Here was a situation! What the deuce was the matter? Did she,
or did she<br>
not, care for him? Was her pride or her delicacy hurt at my being
made the<br>
means of the communication to her father? What had Sparks done or
said to<br>
put himself and me in such a devil of a predicament? Could she
care for any<br>
one else?</p>

<p>"Well, Charley!" cried Mr. Blake, as he entered, rubbing his
hands in a<br>
perfect paroxysm of good temper,&mdash;"well, Charley, has love-making
driven<br>
breakfast out of your head?"</p>

<p>"Why, faith, sir, I greatly fear I have blundered my mission
sadly. My<br>
cousin Mary does not appear so perfectly satisfied; her
manner&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't tell me such nonsense. The girl's manner! Why, man, I
thought you<br>
were too old a soldier to be taken in that way."</p>

<p>"Well, then, sir, the best thing, under the circumstances, is
to send over<br>
Sparks himself. Your consent, I may tell him, is already
obtained."</p>

<p>"Yes, my boy; and my daughter's is equally sure. But I don't
see what we<br>
want with Sparks at all. Among old friends and relatives as we
are, there<br>
is, I think, no need of a stranger."</p>

<p>"A stranger! Very true, sir, he is a stranger; but when that
stranger is<br>
about to become your son-in-law&mdash;"</p>

<p>"About to become what?" said Mr. Blake, rubbing his
spectacles, and placing<br>
them leisurely on his nose to regard me,&mdash;"to become what?"</p>

<p>"Your son-in-law. I hope I have been sufficiently explicit,
sir, in making<br>
known Mr. Sparks's wishes to you."</p>

<p>"Mr. Sparks! Why damn me, sir&mdash;that is&mdash;I beg pardon for
the<br>
warmth&mdash;you&mdash;you never mentioned his name to-day till now. You
led me to<br>
suppose that&mdash;in fact, you told me most clearly&mdash;"</p>

<p>Here, from the united effects of rage and a struggle for
concealment, Mr.<br>
Blake was unable to proceed, and walked the room with a
melodramatic stamp<br>
perfectly awful.</p>

<p>"Really, sir," said I at last, "while I deeply regret any
misconception or<br>
mistake I have been the cause of, I must, in justice to myself,
say that<br>
I am perfectly unconscious of having misled you. I came here this
morning<br>
with a proposition for the hand of your daughter in behalf
of&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yourself, sir. Yes, yourself. I'll be&mdash;no! I'll not swear;
but&mdash;but just<br>
answer me, if you ever mentioned one word of Mr. Sparks, if you
ever<br>
alluded to him till the last few minutes?"</p>

<p>I was perfectly astounded. It might be, alas, it was exactly
as he stated!<br>
In my unlucky effort at extreme delicacy, I became only so very
mysterious<br>
that I left the matter open for them to suppose that it might be
the Khan<br>
of Tartary was in love with Baby.</p>

<p>There was but one course now open. I most humbly apologized
for my blunder;<br>
repeated by every expression I could summon up, my sorrow for
what had<br>
happened; and was beginning a renewal of negotiation "in re
Sparks," when,<br>
overcome by his passion, Mr. Blake could hear no more, but
snatched up his<br>
hat and left the room.</p>

<p>Had it not been for Baby's share in the transaction I should
have laughed<br>
outright. As it was, I felt anything but mirthful; and the only
clear and<br>
collected idea in my mind was to hurry home with all speed, and
fasten a<br>
quarrel on Sparks, the innocent cause of the whole mishap. Why
this thought<br>
struck me let physiologists decide.</p>

<p>A few moments' reflection satisfied me that under present
circumstances,<br>
it would be particularly awkward to meet with any others of the
family.<br>
Ardently desiring to secure my retreat, I succeeded, after some
little<br>
time, in opening the window-sash; consoling myself for any injury
I was<br>
about to inflict upon Mr. Blake's young plantation in my descent,
by the<br>
thought of the service I was rendering him while admitting a
little fresh<br>
air into his sanctum.</p>

<p>For my patriotism's sake I will not record my sensations as I
took my way<br>
through the shrubbery towards the stable. Men are ever so prone
to revenge<br>
their faults and their follies upon such inoffensive agencies as
time and<br>
place, wind or weather, that I was quite convinced that to any
other but<br>
Galway ears my <i>expos&eacute;</i> would have been perfectly clear
and intelligible;<br>
and that in no other country under heaven would a man be expected
to marry<br>
a young lady from a blunder in his grammar.</p>

<p>"Baby may be quite right," thought I; "but one thing is
assuredly true,&mdash;if<br>
I'll never do for Galway, Galway will never do for me. No, hang
it! I have<br>
endured enough for above two years. I have lived in banishment,
away from<br>
society, supposing that, at least, if I isolated myself from the
pleasures<br>
of the world I was exempt from its annoyances." But no; in the
seclusion of<br>
my remote abode troubles found their entrance as easily as
elsewhere, so<br>
that I determined at once to leave home; wherefor, I knew not. If
life had<br>
few charms, it had still fewer ties for me. If I was not bound by
the bonds<br>
of kindred, I was untrammelled by their restraints.</p>

<p>The resolution once taken, I burned to put it into effect; and
so<br>
impatiently did I press forward as to call forth more than one
remonstrance<br>
on the part of Mike at the pace we were proceeding. As I neared
home, the<br>
shrill but stirring sounds of drum and fife met me; and shortly
after a<br>
crowd of country people filled the road. Supposing it some mere
recruiting<br>
party, I was endeavoring to press on, when the sounds of a full
military<br>
band, in the exhilarating measure of a quick-step, convinced me
of my<br>
error; and as I drew to one side of the road, the advanced guard
of an<br>
infantry regiment came forward. The men's faces were flushed,
their<br>
uniforms dusty and travel-stained, their knapsacks strapped
firmly on, and<br>
their gait the steady tramp of the march. Saluting the subaltern,
I asked<br>
if anything of consequence had occurred in the south that the
troops were<br>
so suddenly under orders. The officer stared at me for a moment
or two<br>
without speaking, and while a slight smile half-curled his lip,
answered:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Apparently, sir, you seem very indifferent to military news,
otherwise you<br>
can scarcely be ignorant of the cause of our route."</p>

<p>"On the contrary," said I, "I am, though a young man, an old
soldier, and<br>
feel most anxious about everything connected with the
service."</p>

<p>"Then it is very strange, sir, you should not have heard the
news.<br>
Bonaparte has returned from Elba, has arrived at Paris, been
received with<br>
the most overwhelming enthusiasm, and at this moment the
preparations for<br>
war are resounding from Venice to the Vistula. All our forces,
disposable,<br>
are on the march for embarkation. Lord Wellington has taken the
command,<br>
and already, I may say, the campaign has begun."</p>

<p>The tone of enthusiasm in which the young officer spoke, the
astounding<br>
intelligence itself, contrasting with the apathetic indolence of
my own<br>
life, made me blush deeply, as I, muttered some miserable apology
for my<br>
ignorance.</p>

<p>"And you are now <i>en route?</i>"</p>

<p>"For Fermoy; from which we march to Cove for embarkation. The
first<br>
battalion of our regiment sailed for the West Indies a week
since, but a<br>
frigate has been sent after them to bring them back; and we hope
all to<br>
meet in the Netherlands before the month is over. But I must beg
your<br>
pardon for saying adieu. Good-by, sir."</p>

<p>"Good-by, sir; good-by," said I, as still standing in the
road, I was so<br>
overwhelmed with surprise that I could scarcely credit my
senses.</p>

<p>A little farther on, I came up with the main body of the
regiment, from<br>
whom I learned the corroboration of the news, and also the
additional<br>
intelligence that Sparks had been ordered off with his detachment
early in<br>
the morning, a veteran battalion being sent into garrison in the
various<br>
towns of the south and west.</p>

<p>"Do you happen to know a Mr. O'Malley, sir?" said the major,
coming up with<br>
a note in his hand.</p>

<p>"I beg to present him to you," said I, bowing.</p>

<p>"Well, sir, Sparks gave me this note, which he wrote with a
pencil as we<br>
crossed each other on the road this morning. He told me you were
an old<br>
Fourteenth man. But your regiment is in India, I believe; at
least Power<br>
said they were under orders when we met him."</p>

<p>"Fred Power! Are you acquainted with him? Where is he now,
pray?"</p>

<p>"Fred is on the staff with General Vandeleur, and is now in
Belgium."</p>

<p>"Indeed!" said I, every moment increasing my surprise at some
new piece of<br>
intelligence. "And the Eighty-eighth?" said I, recurring to my
old friends<br>
in that regiment.</p>

<p>"Oh, the Eighty-eighth are at Gibraltar, or somewhere in the
Mediterranean;<br>
at least, I know they are not near enough to open the present
campaign<br>
with us. But if you'd like to hear any more news, you must come
over to<br>
Borrisokane; we stop there to-night."</p>

<p>"Then I'll certainly do so."</p>

<p>"Come at six then, and dine with us."</p>

<p>"Agreed," said I; "and now, good-morning."</p>

<p>So saying, I once more drove on; my head full of all that I
had been<br>
hearing, and my heart bursting with eagerness to join the gallant
fellows<br>
now bound for the campaign.</p>

<br><br><br><br><p>CHAPTER XLIX.</p>

<p>BRUSSELS.</p>

<p>I must not protract a tale already far too long, by the
recital of my<br>
acquaintance with the gallant Twenty-sixth. It is sufficient that
I should<br>
say that, having given Mike orders to follow me to Cove, I joined
the<br>
regiment on their march, and accompanied them to Cork. Every hour
of<br>
each day brought us in news of moment and importance; and amidst
all the<br>
stirring preparations for the war, the account of the splendid
spectacle<br>
of the <i>Champ de Mai</i> burst upon astonished Europe, and the
intelligence<br>
spread far and near that the enthusiasm of France never rose
higher in<br>
favor of the Emperor. And while the whole world prepared for the
deadly<br>
combat, Napoleon surpassed even himself, by the magnificent
conceptions for<br>
the coming conflict, and the stupendous nature of those plans by
which he<br>
resolved on resisting combined and united Europe.</p>

<p>While our admiration and wonder of the mighty spirit that
ruled the<br>
destinies of the continent rose high, so did our own ardent and
burning<br>
desire for the day when the open field of fight should place us
once more<br>
in front of each other.</p>

<p>Every hard-fought engagement of the Spanish war was thought of
and talked<br>
over; from Talavera to Toulouse, all was remembered. And while
among the<br>
old Peninsulars the military ardor was so universally displayed,
among the<br>
regiments who had not shared the glories of Spain and Portugal,
an equal,<br>
perhaps a greater, impulse was created for the approaching
campaign.</p>

<p>When we arrived at Cork, the scene of bustle and excitement
exceeded<br>
anything I ever witnessed. Troops were mustering in every
quarter;<br>
regiments arriving and embarking; fresh bodies of men pouring in;
drills,<br>
parades, and inspections going forward; arms, ammunition, and
military<br>
stores distributing; and amidst all, a spirit of burning
enthusiasm<br>
animated every rank for the approaching glory of the newly-arisen
war.</p>

<p>While thus each was full of his own hopes and expectations, I
alone felt<br>
depressed and downhearted. My military caste was lost to me
forever, my<br>
regiment many, many a mile from the scene of the coming strife;
though<br>
young, I felt like one already old and bygone. The last-joined
ensign<br>
seemed, in his glowing aspiration, a better soldier than I, as,
sad and<br>
dispirited, I wandered through the busy crowds, surveying with
curious eye<br>
each gallant horseman as he rode proudly past. What was wealth
and fortune<br>
to me? What had they ever been, compared with all they cost
me?&mdash;the<br>
abandonment of the career I loved, the path in life I sought and
panted<br>
for. Day after day I lingered on, watching with beating heart
each<br>
detachment as they left the shore; and when their parting cheer
rang high<br>
above the breeze, turned sadly back to mourn over a life that had
failed in<br>
its promise, and an existence now shorn of its enjoyment.</p>

<p>It was on the evening of the 3d of June that I was slowly
wending my way<br>
back towards my hotel. Latterly I had refused all invitations to
dine<br>
at the mess. And by a strange spirit of contradiction, while I
avoided<br>
society, could yet not tear myself away from the spot where
every<br>
remembrance of my past life was daily embittered by the scenes
around me.<br>
But so it was; the movement of the troops, their reviews, their
arrivals,<br>
and departures, possessed the most thrilling interest for me.
While I could<br>
not endure to hear the mention of the high hopes and glorious
vows each<br>
brave fellow muttered.</p>

<p>It was, as I remember, on the evening of the 3d of June, I
entered my hotel<br>
lower in spirits even than usual. The bugles of the gallant
Seventy-first,<br>
as they dropped down with the tide, played a well-known march I
had heard<br>
the night before Talavera. All my bold and hardy days came
rushing madly to<br>
my mind; and my present life seemed no longer endurable. The last
army<br>
list and the newspaper lay on my table, and I turned to read the
latest<br>
promotions with that feeling of bitterness by which an unhappy
man loves to<br>
tamper with his misery.</p>

<p>Almost the first paragraph I threw my eyes upon ran
thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>    OSTEND, May 24.</p>

<p>    The "Vixen" sloop-of-war, which arrived at our port this
morning,<br>
    brought among several other officers of inferior note<br>
    Lieutenant-General Sir George Dashwood, appointed as<br>
    Assistant-Adjutant-General<br>
    on the staff of his Grace the Duke of Wellington. The
gallant<br>
    general was accompanied by his lovely and accomplished
daughter,<br>
    and his military secretary and aide-de-camp, Major
Hammersley,<br>
    of the 2d Life Guards. They partook of a hurried
<i>d&eacute;jeun&eacute;</i><br>
    with the Burgomaster, and left immediately after for
Brussels.</p>

<p>Twice I read this over, while a burning, hot sensation settled
upon my<br>
throat and temples. "So Hammersley still persists; he still
hopes. And<br>
what then?&mdash;what can it be to me?&mdash;my prospects have long since
faded and<br>
vanished! Doubtless, ere this, I am as much forgotten as though
we had<br>
never met,&mdash;would that we never had!" I threw up the window-sash;
a light<br>
breeze was gently stirring, and as it fanned my hot and bursting
head, I<br>
felt cooled and relieved. Some soldiers were talking beneath the
window and<br>
among them I recognized Mike's voice.</p>

<p>"And so you sail at daybreak, Sergeant?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Mister Free; we have our orders to be on board before
the flood-tide.<br>
The 'Thunderer' drops down the harbor to-night, and we are merely
here to<br>
collect our stragglers."</p>

<p>"Faix, it's little I thought I'd ever envy a sodger any more;
but someway,<br>
I wish I was going with you."</p>

<p>"Nothing easier, Mike," said another, laughing.</p>

<p>"Oh, true for you, but that's not the way I'd like to do it.
If my master,<br>
now, would just get over his low spirits, and spake a word to the
Duke of<br>
York, devil a doubt but he'd give him his commission back again,
and then<br>
one might go in comfort."</p>

<p>"Your master likes his feather pillow better than a mossy
stone under his<br>
head, I'm thinking; and he ain't far wrong either."</p>

<p>"You're out there, Neighbor. It's himself cares as little for
hardship as<br>
any one of you; and sure it's not becoming me to say it, but the
best blood<br>
and the best bred was always the last to give in for either cold
or hunger,<br>
ay, or even complain of it."</p>

<p>Mike's few words shot upon me a new and a sudden
conviction,&mdash;what was to<br>
prevent my joining once more? Obvious as such a thought now was,
yet never<br>
until this moment did it present itself so palpably. So
habituated does<br>
the mind become to a certain train of reasoning, framing its
convictions<br>
according to one preconceived plan, and making every fact and<br>
every circumstance concur in strengthening what often may be but
a<br>
prejudice,&mdash;that the absence of the old Fourteenth in India, the
sale of<br>
my commission, the want of rank in the service, all seemed to
present an<br>
insurmountable barrier to my re-entering the army. A few chance
words now<br>
changed all this, and I saw that as a volunteer at least, the
path of glory<br>
was still open, and the thought was no sooner conceived, than the
resolve<br>
to execute it. While, therefore, I walked hurriedly up and down,
devising,<br>
planning, plotting, and contriving, each instant I would stop to
ask myself<br>
how it happened I had not determined upon this before.</p>

<p>As I summoned Mike before me, I could not repress a feeling of
false shame,<br>
as I remembered how suddenly so natural a resolve must seem to
have<br>
been adopted; and it was with somewhat of hesitation that I
opened the<br>
conversation.</p>

<p>"And so, sir, you are going after all,&mdash;long life to you? But
I never<br>
doubted it. Sure, you wouldn't be your father's son, and not join
divarsion<br>
when there was any going on."</p>

<p>The poor fellow's eyes brightened up, his look gladdened, and
before he<br>
reached the foot of the stairs, I heard his loud cheer of delight
that once<br>
more we were off to the wars.</p>

<p>The packet sailed for Liverpool the next morning. By it we
took our<br>
passage, and on the third morning I found myself in the
waiting-room at<br>
the Horse Guards, expecting the moment of his Royal Highness's
arrival; my<br>
determination being to serve as a volunteer in any regiment the
duke might<br>
suggest, until such time as a prospect presented itself of
entering the<br>
service as a subaltern.</p>

<p>The room was crowded by officers of every rank and arm in the
service. The<br>
old, gray-headed general of division; the tall, stout-looking
captain of<br>
infantry; the thin and boyish figure of the newly-gazetted
cornet,&mdash;were<br>
all there; every accent, every look that marked each trait of
national<br>
distinction in the empire, had its representative. The reserved
and distant<br>
Scotchman; the gay, laughing, exuberant Patlander; the dark-eyed,
and<br>
dark-browed North Briton,&mdash;collected in groups, talked eagerly
together;<br>
while every instant, as some new arrival would enter, all eyes
would turn<br>
to the spot, in eager expectation of the duke's coming. At last
the clash<br>
of arms, as the guard turned out, apprised us of his approach,
and we<br>
had scarcely time to stand up and stop the buzz of voices, when
the door<br>
opened, and an aide-de-camp proclaimed in a full tone,&mdash;</p>

<p>"His Royal Highness the Commander-in-Chief!"</p>

<p>Bowing courteously on every side, he advanced through the
crowd, turning<br>
his rapid and piercing look here and there through the room,
while with<br>
that tact, the essential gift of his family, he recognized each
person by<br>
his name, directing from one to the other some passing
observation.</p>

<p>"Ah, Sir George Cockburn, how d' ye do?&mdash;your son's
appointment is made<br>
out. Major Conyers, that application shall be looked to. Forbes,
you must<br>
explain that I cannot possibly put men in the regiment of their
choice; the<br>
service is the first thing. Lord L&mdash;&mdash;, your memorial is before
the Prince<br>
Regent; the cavalry command will, I believe, however, include
your name."</p>

<p>While he spoke thus, he approached the place where I was
standing, when,<br>
suddenly checking himself, he looked at me for a moment somewhat
sternly.<br>
"Why not in uniform, sir?"</p>

<p>"Your Royal Highness, I am not in the army."</p>

<p>"Not in the army&mdash;not in the army? And why, may I beg to know,
have<br>
you&mdash;But I'm speaking to <i>Captain</i> O'Malley, if I mistake
not?"</p>

<p>"I held that rank, sir, once; but family necessities compelled
me to sell<br>
out. I have now no commission in the service, but am come to
beseech your<br>
Royal Highness's permission to serve as a volunteer."</p>

<p>"As a volunteer, eh&mdash;a volunteer? Come, that's right, I like
that; but<br>
still, we want such fellows as you,&mdash;the man of Ciudad Rodrigo.
Yes, my<br>
Lord L&mdash;&mdash;, this is one of the stormers; fought his way through
the trench<br>
among the first; must not be neglected. Hold yourself in
readiness,<br>
Captain&mdash;hang it, I was forgetting; Mr. O'Malley, I mean&mdash;hold
yourself<br>
in readiness for a staff appointment. Smithson, take a note of
this."<br>
So saying, he moved on; and I found myself in the street, with a
heart<br>
bounding with delight, and a step proud as an emperor's.</p>

<p>With such rapidity the events of my life now followed one upon
the other,<br>
that I could take no note of time as it passed. On the fourth day
after<br>
my conversation with the duke I found myself in Brussels. As yet
I heard<br>
nothing of the appointment, nor was I gazetted to any regiment or
any<br>
situation on the staff. It was strange enough, too, I met but few
of my old<br>
associates, and not one of those with whom I had been most
intimate in my<br>
Peninsular career; but it so chanced that very many of the
regiments who<br>
most distinguished themselves in the Spanish campaigns, at the
peace of<br>
1814 were sent on foreign service. My old friend Power was, I
learned,<br>
quartered at Courtrai; and as I was perfectly at liberty to
dispose of my<br>
movements at present, I resolved to visit him there.</p>

<p>It was a beautiful evening on the 12th of June. I had been
inquiring<br>
concerning post-horses for my journey, and was returning slowly
through<br>
the park. The hour was late&mdash;near midnight&mdash;but a pale moonlight,
a calm,<br>
unruffled air, and stronger inducements still, the song of the
nightingales<br>
that abound in this place, prevailed on many of the loungers to
prolong<br>
their stay; and so from many a shady walk and tangled arbor, the
clank of<br>
a sabre would strike upon the ear, or the low, soft voice of
woman would<br>
mingle her dulcet sound with the deep tones of her companion. I
wandered<br>
on, thoughtful and alone; my mind pre-occupied so completely with
the<br>
mighty events passing before me, I totally forgot my own humble
career, and<br>
the circumstances of my fortune. As I turned into an alley which
leads from<br>
the Great Walk towards the Palace of the Prince of Orange, I
found my path<br>
obstructed by three persons who were walking slowly along in
front of me.<br>
I was, as I have mentioned, deeply absorbed in thought, so that I
found<br>
myself close behind them before I was aware of their presence.
Two of the<br>
party were in uniform, and by their plumes, upon which a passing
ray of<br>
moonlight flickered, I could detect they were general officers;
the<br>
third was a lady. Unable to pass them, and unwilling to turn
back, I<br>
was unavoidably compelled to follow, and however unwilling, to
overhear<br>
somewhat of their conversation.</p>

<p>"You mistake, George, you mistake! Depend upon it, this will
be no<br>
lengthened campaign; victory will soon decide for one side or the
other.<br>
If Napoleon beats the Prussians one day, and beat us the next,
the German<br>
States will rally to his standard, and the old confederation of
the Rhine<br>
will spring up once more in all the plenitude of its power. The
<i>Champ de<br>
Mai</i> has shown the enthusiasm of France for their Emperor. Louis
XVIII fled<br>
from his capital, with few to follow, and none to say, 'God bless
him!' The<br>
warlike spirit of the nation is roused again; the interval of
peace, too<br>
short to teach habits of patient and enduring industry, is yet
sufficient<br>
to whet the appetite for carnage; and nothing was wanting, save
the<br>
presence of Napoleon alone, to restore all the brilliant
delusions and<br>
intoxicating splendors of the empire."</p>

<p>"I confess," said the other, "I take a very different view
from yours in<br>
this matter; to me, it seems that France is as tired of battles
as of the<br>
Bourbons&mdash;"</p>

<p>I heard no more; for though the speaker continued, a misty
confusion passed<br>
across my mind. The tones of his voice, well-remembered as they
were by me,<br>
left me unable to think; and as I stood motionless on the spot, I
muttered<br>
half aloud, "Sir George Dashwood." It was he, indeed; and she who
leaned<br>
upon his arm could be no other than Lucy herself. I know not how
it was;<br>
for many a long month I had schooled my heart, and taught myself
to believe<br>
that time had dulled the deep impression she had made upon me,
and that,<br>
were we to meet again, it would be with more sorrow on my part
for my<br>
broken dream of happiness than of attachment and affection for
her who<br>
inspired it; but now, scarcely was I near her&mdash;I had not gazed
upon her<br>
looks, I had not even heard her voice&mdash;and yet, in all their
ancient force,<br>
came back the early passages of my love; and as her footfall
sounded gently<br>
upon the ground, my heart beat scarce less audibly. Alas, I could
no<br>
longer disguise from myself the avowal that she it was, and she
only, who<br>
implanted in my heart the thirst for distinction; and the moment
was ever<br>
present to my mind in which, as she threw her arms around her
father's<br>
neck, she muttered, "Oh, why not a soldier!"</p>

<p>As I thus reflected, an officer in full dress passed me
hurriedly,<br>
and taking off his hat as he came up with the party before me,
bowed<br>
obsequiously.</p>

<p>"My Lord &mdash;&mdash;, I believe, and Sir George Dashwood?" They
replied by a<br>
bow. "Sir Thomas Picton wishes to speak with you both for a
moment; he is<br>
standing beside the 'Basin.' If you will permit&mdash;" said he,
looking towards<br>
Lucy.</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir," said Sir George; "if you will have the
goodness to<br>
accompany us, my daughter will wait our coming here. Sit down,
Lucy, we<br>
shall not be long away."</p>

<p>The next moment she was alone. The last echoes of their
retiring footsteps<br>
had died away in the grassy walk, and in the calm and death-like
stillness<br>
I could hear every rustle of her silk dress. The moonlight fell
in<br>
fitful, straggling gleams between the leafy branches, and showed
me her<br>
countenance, pale as marble. Her eyes were upturned slightly; her
brown<br>
hair, divided upon her fair forehead, sparkled with a wreath of
brilliants,<br>
which heightened the lustrous effect of her calm beauty; and now
I could<br>
perceive her dress bespoke that she had been at some of the
splendid<br>
entertainments which followed day after day in the busy
capital.</p>

<p>Thus I stood within a few paces of <i>her</i>, to be near to whom,
a few hours<br>
before, I would willingly have given all I possessed in the
world; and yet<br>
now a barrier, far more insurmountable than time and space,
intervened<br>
between us; still it seemed as though fortune had presented this
incident<br>
as a last farewell between us. Why should I not take advantage of
it? Why<br>
should I not seize the only opportunity that might ever occur of
rescuing<br>
myself from the apparent load of ingratitude which weighed on my
memory?<br>
I felt in the cold despair of my heart that I could have no hold
upon her<br>
affection; but a pride, scarce less strong that the attachment
that gave<br>
rise to it, urged me to speak. By one violent effort I summoned
up my<br>
courage; and while I resolved to limit the few words I should say
merely<br>
to my vindication, I prepared to advance. Just at this instant,
however, a<br>
shadow crossed the path; a rustling sound was heard among the
branches, and<br>
the tall figure of a man in a dragoon cloak stood before me. Lucy
turned<br>
suddenly at the sound; but scarcely had her eyes been bent in
the<br>
direction, when, throwing off his cloak, he sprang forward and
dropped at<br>
her feet. All my feeling of shame at the part I was performing
was now<br>
succeeded by a sense of savage and revengeful hatred. It was
enough that<br>
I should be brought to look upon her whom I had lost forever
without the<br>
added bitterness of witnessing her preference for a rival. The
whirlwind<br>
passion of my brain stunned and stupefied me. Unconsciously I
drew my sword<br>
from my scabbard, and it was only as the pale light fell upon the
keen<br>
blade that the thought flashed across me, "What could I mean to
do?"</p>

<p>"No, Hammersley,"&mdash;it was he indeed,&mdash;said she, "it is unkind,
it is<br>
unfair, nay, it is unmanly to press me thus; I would not pain
you, were<br>
it not that, in sparing you now, I should entail deeper injury
upon you<br>
hereafter. Ask me to be your sister, your friend; ask me to feel
proudly<br>
in your triumphs, to glory in your success; all this I do feel;
but, oh! I<br>
beseech you, as you value your happiness, as you prize mine, ask
me no more<br>
than this."</p>

<p>There was a pause of some seconds; and at length, the low
tones of a man's<br>
voice, broken and uncertain in their utterance, said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"I know it&mdash;I feel it&mdash;my heart never bade me hope&mdash;and
now&mdash;'tis over."</p>

<p>He stood up as he spoke, and while he threw the light folds of
his mantle<br>
round him, a gleam of light fell upon his features. They were
pale as<br>
death; two dark circles surrounded his sunken eyes, and his
bloodless lip<br>
looked still more ghastly, from the dark mustache that drooped
above it.</p>

<p>"Farewell!" said he, slowly, as he crossed his arms sadly upon
his breast;<br>
"I will not pain you more."</p>

<p>"Oh, go not thus from me!" said she, as her voice became
tremulous with<br>
emotion; "do not add to the sorrow that weighs upon my heart! I
cannot,<br>
indeed I cannot, be other than I am; and I do but hate myself to
think that<br>
I cannot give my love where I have given all my esteem. If
time&mdash;" But<br>
before she could continue further, the noise of approaching
footsteps was<br>
heard, and the voice of Sir George, as he came near. Hammersley
disappeared<br>
at once, and Lucy, with rapid steps, advanced to meet her father,
while I<br>
remained riveted upon the spot. What a torrent of emotions then
rushed upon<br>
my heart! What hopes, long dead or dying, sprang up to life
again! What<br>
visions of long-abandoned happiness flitted before me! Could it
be<br>
then&mdash;dare I trust myself to think it&mdash;that Lucy cared for me?
The thought<br>
was maddening! With a bounding sense of ecstasy, I dashed across
the park,<br>
resolving, at all hazards, to risk everything upon the chance,
and wait<br>
the next morning upon Sir George Dashwood. As I thought thus, I
reached my<br>
hotel, where I found Mike in waiting with a letter. As I walked
towards the<br>
lamp in the <i>porte cochere</i>, my eyes fell upon the address. It
was General<br>
Dashwood's hand; I tore it open, and read as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>    Dear Sir,&mdash;Circumstances into which you will excuse me
entering,<br>
    having placed an insurmountable barrier to our former terms
of<br>
    intimacy, you will, I trust, excuse me declining the honor of
any<br>
    nearer acquaintance, and also forgive the liberty I take in
informing<br>
    you of it, which step, however unpleasant to my feelings,
will save<br>
    us both the great pain of meeting.</p>

<p>    I have only this moment heard of your arrival in Brussels,
and<br>
    take thus the earliest opportunity of communicating with
you.<br>
    With every assurance of my respect for you personally, and
an<br>
    earnest desire to serve you in your military career, I beg to
remain,</p>

<p>    Very faithfully yours,</p>

<p>    GEORGE DASHWOOD</p>

<p>"Another note, sir," said Mike, as he thrust into my
unconscious hands a<br>
letter he had just received from an orderly.</p>

<p>Stunned, half stupefied, I broke the seal. The contents were
but three<br>
lines:&mdash;</p>

<p>    Sir,&mdash;I have the honor to inform you that Sir Thomas
Picton has<br>
    appointed you an extra aide-de-camp on his personal staff.
You will,<br>
    therefore, present yourself to-morrow morning at the
Adjutant-General's<br>
    office, to receive your appointment and instructions.<br>
    I have the honor to be, etc.,</p>

<p>    G. FITZROY.</p>

<p>Crushing the two letters in my fevered hand, I retired to my
room, and<br>
threw myself, dressed as I was, upon my bed. Sleep, that seems to
visit us<br>
in the saddest as in the happiest times of our existence, came
over me,<br>
and I did not wake until the bugles of the Ninety-fifth were
sounding the<br>
reveille through the park, and the brightest beams of the morning
sun were<br>
peering through the window.</p>

<br><br><br><br><p>CHAPTER L.</p>

<p>AN OLD ACQUAINTANCE.</p>

<p>"Mr. O'Malley," said a voice, as my door opened, and an
officer in undress<br>
entered,&mdash;"Mr. O'Malley, I believe you received your appointment
last night<br>
on General Picton's staff?"</p>

<p>I bowed in reply, as he resumed:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Sir Thomas desires you will proceed to Courtrai with these
despatches in<br>
all haste. I don't know if you are well mounted, but I recommend
you, in<br>
any case, not to spare your cattle."</p>

<p>So saying, he wished me a good-morning, and left me, in a
state of no small<br>
doubt and difficulty, to my own reflections. What the deuce was I
to do?<br>
I had no horse; I knew not where to find one. What uniform should
I wear?<br>
For, although appointed on the staff, I was not gazetted to any
regiment<br>
that I knew of, and hitherto had been wearing an undress frock
and a<br>
foraging cap; for I could not bring myself to appear as a
civilian among<br>
so many military acquaintances. No time was, however, to be lost;
so I<br>
proceeded to put on my old Fourteenth uniform, wondering whether
my costume<br>
might not cost me a reprimand in the very outset of my career.
Meanwhile<br>
I despatched Mike to see after a horse, caring little for the
time, the<br>
merits, or the price of the animal provided he served my present
purpose.</p>

<p>In less than twenty minutes my worthy follower appeared
beneath my window,<br>
surrounded by a considerable mob, who seemed to take no small
interest in<br>
the proceedings.</p>

<p>"What the deuce is the matter?" cried I, as I opened the sash
and looked<br>
out.</p>

<p>"Mighty little's the matter, your honor; it's the savages,
here,<br>
that's admiring my horsemanship," said Mike, as he belabored a
tall,<br>
scraggy-looking mule with a stick which bore an uncommon
resemblance to a<br>
broom-handle.</p>

<p>"What do you mean to do with that beast?" said I. "You surely
don't expect<br>
me to ride a mule to Courtrai?"</p>

<p>"Faith, and if you don't, you are likely to walk the journey;
for there<br>
isn't a horse to be had for love or money in the town; but I am
told that<br>
Mr. Marsden is coming up to-morrow with plenty, so that you may
as well<br>
take the journey out of the soft horns as spoil a better; and if
he only<br>
makes as good use of his fore-legs as he does of his hind ones,
he'll think<br>
little of the road."</p>

<p>[MICKEY ASTONISHES THE NATIVES.]</p>
<br><br>

<p>A vicious lash out behind served in a moment to corroborate
Mike's<br>
assertion, and to scatter the crowd on every side.</p>

<p>However indisposed to exhibit myself with such a turn-out, my
time did not<br>
admit of any delay; and so, arming myself with my despatches, and
having<br>
procured the necessary information as to the road, I set out from
the Belle<br>
Vue, amidst an ill-suppressed titter of merriment from the mob,
which<br>
nothing but fear of Mike and his broomstick prevented becoming a
regular<br>
shout of laughter.</p>

<p>It was near night-fall as, tired and weary of the road, I
entered the<br>
little village of Halle. All was silent and noiseless in the
deserted<br>
streets; nor a lamp threw its glare upon the pavement, nor even a
solitary<br>
candle flickered through the casement. Unlike a town, garrisoned
by troops,<br>
neither sentry nor outpost was to be met with; nothing gave
evidence that<br>
the place was held by a large body of men; and I could not help
feeling<br>
struck, as the footsteps of my mule were echoed along the
causeway, with<br>
the silence almost of desolation around me. By the creaking of a
sign, as<br>
it swung mournfully to and fro, I was directed to the door of the
village<br>
inn, where, dismounting, I knocked for some moments, but without
success.<br>
At length, when I had made an uproar sufficient to alarm the
entire<br>
village, the casement above the door slowly opened, and a head
enveloped<br>
in a huge cotton nightcap&mdash;so, at least, it appeared to me from
the<br>
size&mdash;protruded itself. After muttering a curse in about the most
barbarous<br>
French I ever heard, he asked me what I wanted there; to which I
replied,<br>
most nationally, by asking in return, where the British dragoons
were<br>
quartered.</p>

<p>"They have left for Nivelle this morning, to join some
regiments of your<br>
own country."</p>

<p>"Ah! ah!" thought I, "he mistakes me for a Brunswicker;" to
which, by<br>
the uncertain light, my uniform gave me some resemblance. As it
was now<br>
impossible for me to proceed farther, I begged to ask where I
could procure<br>
accommodation for the night.</p>

<p>"At the burgomaster's. Turn to your left at the end of this
street, and<br>
you will soon find it. They have got some English officers there,
who, I<br>
believe in my soul, never sleep."</p>

<p>This was, at least, pleasant intelligence, and promised a
better<br>
termination to my journey than I had begun to hope for; so
wishing my<br>
friend a good-night, to which he willingly responded, I resumed
my way<br>
down the street. As he closed the window, once more leaving me to
my own<br>
reflections, I began to wonder within myself to what arm of the
service<br>
belonged these officers to whose convivial gifts he bore
testimony. As I<br>
turned the corner of the street, I soon discovered the
correctness of his<br>
information. A broad glare of light stretched across the entire
pavement<br>
from a large house with a clumsy stone portico before it. On
coming nearer,<br>
the sound of voices, the roar of laughter, the shouts of
merriment that<br>
issued forth, plainly bespoke that a jovial party were seated
within.<br>
The half-shutter which closed the lower part of the windows
prevented my<br>
obtaining a view of the proceedings; but having cautiously
approached the<br>
casement, I managed to creep on the window-sill and look into the
room.</p>

<img alt="0412.jpg (154K)" src="0412.jpg" height="1043" width="672">

<p>[THE GENTLEMEN WHO NEVER SLEEP.]</p>
<br><br>

<p>There the scene was certainly a curious one. Around a large
table sat a<br>
party of some twenty persons, the singularity of whose appearance
may<br>
be conjectured when I mention that all those who appeared to be
British<br>
officers were dressed in the robes of the <i>&eacute;chevins</i> (or
aldermen) of the<br>
village; while some others, whose looks bespoke them as sturdy
Flemings,<br>
sported the cocked hats and cavalry helmets of their associates.
He who<br>
appeared the ruler of the feast sat with his back towards me, and
wore, in<br>
addition to the dress of burgomaster, a herald's tabard, which
gave him<br>
something the air of a grotesque screen at its potations. A huge
fire<br>
blazed upon the ample hearth, before which were spread several
staff<br>
uniforms, whose drabbled and soaked appearance denoted the reason
of the<br>
party's change of habiliments. Every imaginable species of
drinking-vessel<br>
figured upon the board, from the rich flagon of chased silver to
the humble<br>
<i>cruche</i> we see in a Teniers picture. As well as I could hear,
the language<br>
of the company seemed to be French, or, at least, such an
imitation of that<br>
language as served as a species of neutral territory for both
parties to<br>
meet in.</p>

<p>He of the tabard spoke louder than the others, and although,
from the<br>
execrable endeavors he made to express himself in French, his
natural voice<br>
was much altered, there was yet something in his accents which
seemed<br>
perfectly familiar to me.</p>

<p>"Mosheer l'Abbey," said he, placing his arm familiarly on the
shoulder of<br>
a portly personage, whose shaven crown strangely contrasted with
a pair<br>
of corked moustachios,&mdash;"Mosheer l'Abbey, nous sommes
fr&egrave;res, et moi,<br>
savez-vous, suis &eacute;v&egrave;que,&mdash;'pon my life it's true; I
might have been Bishop<br>
of Saragossa, if I only consented to leave the Twenty-third. Je
suis bong<br>
Catholique. Lord bless you, if you saw how I loved the nunneries
in Spain!<br>
J'ai tres jolly souvenirs of those nunneries; a goodly company of
little<br>
silver saints; and this waistcoat you see&mdash;mong gilet&mdash;was a
satin<br>
petticoat of our Lady of Loretto."</p>

<p>Need I say, that before this speech was concluded, I had
recognized in the<br>
speaker nobody but that inveterate old villain, Monsoon
himself.</p>

<p>"Permettez, votre Excellence," said a hale, jolly-looking
personage on his<br>
left, as he filled the major's goblet with obsequious
politeness.</p>

<p>"Bong engfong," replied Monsoon, tapping him familiarly on the
head.<br>
"Burgomaster, you are a trump; and when I get my promotion, I'll
make<br>
you prefect in a wine district. Pass the lush, and don't look
sleepy!<br>
'Drowsiness,' says Solomon, 'clothes a man in rags;' and no man
knew the<br>
world better than Solomon. Don't you be laughing, you raw boys.
Never mind<br>
them, Abbey; ils sont petits gar&ccedil;ongs&mdash;fags from Eton and
Harrow; better<br>
judges of mutton broth than sherry negus."</p>

<p>"I say, Major, you are forgetting this song you promised
us."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," said several voices together; "the song, Major!
the song!"</p>

<p>"Time enough for that; we're doing very well as it is. Upon my
life,<br>
though, they hold a deal of wine. I thought we'd have had them
fit to<br>
bargain with before ten, and see, it's near midnight; and I must
have my<br>
forage accounts ready for the commissary-general by to-morrow
morning."</p>

<p>This speech having informed me the reason of the Major's
presence there,<br>
I resolved to wait no longer a mere spectator of their
proceedings; so<br>
dismounting from my position, I commenced a vigorous attack upon
the door.</p>

<p>It was some time before I was heard; but at length the door
was opened, and<br>
I was accosted by an Englishman, who, in a strange compound of
French and<br>
English, asked, "What the devil I meant by all that uproar?"
Determining<br>
to startle my old friend the major, I replied, that "I was
aide-de-camp to<br>
General Picton, and had come down on very unpleasant business."
By this<br>
time the noise of the party within had completely subsided, and
from a few<br>
whispered sentences, and their thickened breathing, I perceived
that they<br>
were listening.</p>

<p>"May I ask, sir," continued I, "if Major Monsoon is here?"</p>

<p>"Yes," stammered out the ensign, for such he was.</p>

<p>"Sorry for it, for his sake," said I; "but my orders are
peremptory."</p>

<p>A deep groan from within, and a muttered request to pass down
the sherry,<br>
nearly overcame my gravity; but I resumed:&mdash;</p>

<p>"If you will permit me, I will make the affair as short as
possible. The<br>
major, I presume, is here?"</p>

<p>So saying, I pushed forward into the room, where now a slight
scuffling<br>
noise and murmur of voices had succeeded silence. Brief as was
the<br>
interval of our colloquy, the scene within had, notwithstanding,
undergone<br>
considerable change. The English officers, hastily throwing off
their<br>
aldermanic robes, were busily arraying themselves in their
uniforms, while<br>
Monsoon himself, with a huge basin of water before him, was
endeavoring to<br>
wash the cork from his countenance in the corner of his
tabard.</p>

<p>"Very hard upon me, all this; upon my life, so it is! Picton
is always at<br>
me, just as if we had not been school-fellows. The service is
getting worse<br>
every day. Regardez-moi, Curey, mong face est propre? Eh? There,
thank you.<br>
Good fellow the Curey is, but takes a deal of fluid. Oh,
Burgomaster! I<br>
fear it is all up with me! No more fun, no more jollification, no
more<br>
plunder&mdash;and how I did do it. Nothing like watching one's little
chances!<br>
'The poor is hated even by his neighbor.' Oui, Curey, it is
Solomon says<br>
that, and they must have had a heavy poor-rate in his day to make
him say<br>
so. Another glass of sherry!"</p>

<p>By this time I approached the back of the chair, and slapping
him heartily<br>
on the shoulder, called out,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Major, old boy, how goes it?"</p>

<p>"Eh?&mdash;what&mdash;how!&mdash;who is this? It can't be&mdash;egad, sure it is,
though.<br>
Charley! Charley O'Malley, you scapegrace, where have you been?
When did<br>
you join?"</p>

<p>"A week ago, Major. I could resist it no longer. I did my best
to be a<br>
country gentleman, and behave respectably, but the old temptation
was too<br>
strong for me. Fred Power and yourself, Major, had ruined my
education; and<br>
here I am once more among you."</p>

<p>"And so Picton and the arrest and all that, was nothing but a
joke?" said<br>
the old fellow, rolling his wicked eyes with a most cunning
expression.</p>

<p>"Nothing more, Major, set your heart at rest."</p>

<p>"What a scamp you are," said he, with another grin. "Il est
mon fils&mdash;il<br>
est mon fils, Curey," presenting me, as he spoke, while the
burgomaster, in<br>
whose eyes the major seemed no inconsiderable personage, saluted
me with<br>
profound respect.</p>

<p>Turning at once towards this functionary, I explained that I
was the<br>
bearer of important despatches, and that my horse&mdash;I was ashamed
to say my<br>
mule&mdash;having fallen lame, I was unable to proceed.</p>

<p>"Can you procure me a remount, Monsieur?" said I, "for I must
hasten on to<br>
Courtrai."</p>

<p>"In half an hour you shall be provided, as well as with a
mounted guide for<br>
the road. Le fils de son Excellence," said he, with emphasis,
bowing to the<br>
major as he spoke; who, in his turn, repaid the courtesy with a
still lower<br>
obeisance.</p>

<p>"Sit down, Charley; here is a clean glass. I am delighted to
see you, my<br>
boy! They tell me you have got a capital estate and plenty of
ready. Lord,<br>
we so wanted you, as there's scarcely a fellow with sixpence
among us. Give<br>
me the lad that can do a bit of paper at three months, and always
be ready<br>
for a renewal. You haven't got a twenty-pound note?" This was
said <i>sotto<br>
voce</i>. "Never mind; ten will do. You can give me the remainder at
Brussels.<br>
Strange, is it not, I have not seen a bit of clean bank paper
like this for<br>
above a twelvemonth!" This was said as he thrust his hand into
his pocket,<br>
with one of those peculiar leers upon his countenance which,
unfortunately,<br>
betrayed more satisfaction at his success than gratitude for the
service.<br>
"You are looking fat&mdash;too fat, I think," said he, scrutinizing me
from head<br>
to foot; "but the life we are leading just now will soon take
that off. The<br>
slave-trade is luxurious indolence compared to it. Post haste to
Nivelle<br>
one day; down to Ghent the next; forty miles over a paved road in
a<br>
hand-gallop, and an aide-de-camp with a watch in his hand at the
end of it,<br>
to report if you are ten minutes too late. And there is
Wellington has his<br>
eye everywhere. There is not a truss of hay served to the
cavalry, nor a<br>
pair of shoes half-soled in the regiment, that he don't know of
it. I've<br>
got it over the knuckles already."</p>

<p>"How so, Major? How was that?"</p>

<p>"Why, he ordered me to picket two squadrons of the Seventh,
and a supper<br>
was waiting. I didn't like to leave my quarters, so I took up my
telescope<br>
and pitched upon a sweet little spot of ground on a hill; rather
difficult<br>
to get up, to be sure, but a beautiful view when you're on it.
'There is<br>
your ground, Captain,' said I, as I sent one of my people to mark
the spot.<br>
He did not like it much; however, he was obliged to go. And,
would you<br>
believe it?&mdash;so much for bad luck!&mdash;there turned out to be no
water within<br>
two miles of it&mdash;not a drop, Charley; and so, about eleven at
night, the<br>
two squadrons moved down into Grammont to wet their lips, and
what is<br>
worse, to report me to the commanding officer. And only think!
They put me<br>
under arrest because Providence did not make a river run up a
mountain!"</p>

<p>Just as the major finished speaking, the distant clatter of
horses' feet<br>
and the clank of cavalry was heard approaching. We all rushed
eagerly to<br>
the door; and scarcely had we done so, when a squadron of
dragoons came<br>
riding up the street at a fast trot.</p>

<p>"I say, good people," cried the officer, in French, "where
does the<br>
burgomaster live here?"</p>

<p>"Fred Power, 'pon my life!" shouted the major.</p>

<p>"Eh, Monsoon, that you? Give me a tumbler of wine, old boy;
you are sure to<br>
have some, and I am desperately blown."</p>

<p>"Get down, Fred, get down! We have an old friend here."</p>

<p>"Who the deuce d'ye mean?" said he, as throwing himself from
the saddle he<br>
strode into the room. "Charley O'Malley, by all that's
glorious!"</p>

<p>"Fred, my gallant fellow!" said I.</p>

<p>"It was but this morning, Charley, that I so wished for you
here. The<br>
French are advancing, my lad. They have crossed the frontier;
Zeithen's<br>
corps have been attacked and driven in; Blucher is falling back
upon Ligny;<br>
and the campaign is opened. But I must press forward. The
regiment is close<br>
behind me, and we are ordered to push for Brussels in all
haste."</p>

<p>"Then these despatches," said I, showing my packet, "'tis
unnecessary to<br>
proceed with?"</p>

<p>"Quite so. Get into the saddle and come back with us."</p>

<p>The burgomaster had kept his word with me; so mounted upon a
strong<br>
hackney, I set out with Power on the road to Brussels. I have had
occasion<br>
more than once to ask pardon of my reader for the prolixity of
my<br>
narrative, so I shall not trespass on him here by the detail of
our<br>
conversation as we jogged along. Of me and my adventures he
already knows<br>
enough&mdash;perhaps too much. My friend Power's career, abounding as
it did in<br>
striking incidents, and all the light and shadow of a soldier's
life,<br>
yet not bearing upon any of the characters I have presented to
your<br>
acquaintance, except in one instance,&mdash;of that only shall I
speak.</p>

<p>"And the senhora, Fred; how goes your fortune in that
quarter?"</p>

<p>"Gloriously, Charley! I am every day expecting the promotion
in my regiment<br>
which is to make her mine."</p>

<p>"You have heard from her lately, then?"</p>

<p>"Heard from her! Why, man, she is in Brussels."</p>

<p>"In Brussels?"</p>

<p>"To be sure. Don Emanuel is in high favor with the duke, and
is now<br>
commissary-general with the army; and the senhora is the <i>belle</i>
of the<br>
Rue Royale, or at least, it's a divided sovereignty between her
and Lucy<br>
Dashwood. And now, Charley, let me ask, what of her? There,
there, don't<br>
blush, man. There is quite enough moonlight to show how tender
you are in<br>
that quarter."</p>

<p>"Once for all, Fred, pray spare me on that subject. You have
been far too<br>
fortunate in your <i>affaire de coeur</i>, and I too much the reverse,
to permit<br>
much sympathy between us."</p>

<p>"Do you not visit, then; or is it a cut between you?" "I have
never met her<br>
since the night of the masquerade of the villa&mdash;at least, to
speak to&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, I must confess, you seem to manage your own affairs
much worse than<br>
your friends'; not but that in so doing you are exhibiting a very
Irish<br>
feature of your character. In any case, you will come to the
ball? Inez<br>
will be delighted to see you; and I have got over all my
jealousy."</p>

<p>"What ball? I never heard of it."</p>

<p>"Never heard of it! Why, the Duchess of Richmond's, of course.
Pooh, pooh,<br>
man! Not invited?&mdash;of course you are invited; the staff are never
left out<br>
on such occasions. You will find your card at your hotel on your
return."</p>

<p>"In any case, Fred&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I shall insist upon your going. I have no <i>arri&egrave;re
pens&eacute;e</i> about a<br>
reconciliation with the Dashwoods, no subtle scheme, on my honor;
but<br>
simply I feel that you will never give yourself fair chances in
the world,<br>
by indulging your habit of shrinking from every embarrassment.
Don't be<br>
offended, boy. I know you have pluck enough to storm a battery; I
have seen<br>
you under fire before now. What avails your courage in the field,
if you<br>
have not presence of mind in the drawing-room? Besides,
everything else out<br>
of the question, it is a breach of etiquette towards your chief
to decline<br>
such an invitation."</p>

<p>"You think so?"</p>

<p>"Think so?&mdash;no; I am sure of it."</p>

<p>"Then, as to uniform, Fred?"</p>

<p>"Oh, as to that, easily managed. And now I think of it, they
have sent me<br>
an unattached uniform, which you can have; but remember, my boy,
if I put<br>
you in my coat, I don't want you to stand in my shoes. Don't
forget also<br>
that I am your debtor in horseflesh, and fortunately able to
repay you. I<br>
have got such a charger; your own favorite color, dark chestnut,
and<br>
except one white leg, not a spot about him; can carry sixteen
stone over a<br>
five-foot fence, and as steady as a rock under fire."</p>

<p>"But, Fred, how are you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, never mind me; I have six in my stable, and intend to
share with you.<br>
The fact is, I have been transferred from one staff to another
for the last<br>
six months, and four of my number are presents. Is Mike with you?
Ah, glad<br>
to hear it; you will never get on without that fellow. Besides,
it is a<br>
capital thing to have such a connecting link with one's
nationality. No<br>
fear of your ever forgetting Ireland with Mr. Free in your
company. You<br>
are not aware that we have been correspondents. A fact, I assure
you. Mike<br>
wrote me two letters; and such letters they were! The last was a
Jeremiad<br>
over your decline and fall, with a very ominous picture of a
certain Miss<br>
Baby Blake."</p>

<p>"Confound the rascal!"</p>

<p>"By Jove, though, Charley, you were coming it rather strong
with Baby. Inez<br>
saw the letter, and as well as she could decipher Mike's
hieroglyphics, saw<br>
there was something in it; but the name Baby puzzled her
immensely, and she<br>
set the whole thing down to your great love of children. I don't
think that<br>
Lucy quite agreed with her."</p>

<p>"Did she tell it to Miss Dashwood?" I inquired, with fear and
trembling.</p>

<p>"Oh, that she did; in fact, Inez never ceases talking of you
to Lucy. But<br>
come, lad, don't look so grave. Let's have another brush with the
enemy;<br>
capture a battery of their guns; carry off a French marshal or
two; get the<br>
Bath for your services, and be thanked in general orders,&mdash;and I
will wager<br>
all my <i>ch&acirc;teau en Espagne</i> that everything goes well."</p>

<p>Thus chatting away, sometimes over the past, of our former
friends and<br>
gay companions, of our days of storm and sunshine; sometimes
indulging in<br>
prospects for the future, we trotted along, and as the day was
breaking,<br>
mounted the ridge of low hills, from whence, at the distance of a
couple of<br>
leagues, the city of Brussels came into view.</p>

<br><br><br><br><p>CHAPTER LI.</p>

<p>THE DUCHESS OF RICHMOND'S BALL.</p>

<p>Whether we regard the illustrious and distinguished personages
who thronged<br>
around, or we think of the portentous moment in which it was
given, the<br>
Duchess of Richmond's ball, on the night of the 15th of June,
1815, was not<br>
only one of the most memorable, but, in its interest, the most
exciting<br>
entertainment that the memory of any one now living can
compass.</p>

<p>There is always something of no common interest in seeing the
bronzed and<br>
war-worn soldier mixing in the crowd of light-hearted and
brilliant<br>
beauty. To watch the eye whose proud glance has flashed over the
mail-clad<br>
squadrons now bending meekly beneath the look of some timid girl;
to hear<br>
the voice that, high above the battle or the breeze, has shouted
the<br>
hoarse word "Charge!" now subdued into the low, soft murmur of
flattery or<br>
compliment. This, at any rate, is a picture full of its own
charm; but when<br>
we see these heroes of a hundred fights; when we look upon these
hardy<br>
veterans, upon whose worn brows the whitened locks of time are
telling,<br>
indulging themselves in the careless gayety of a moment, snatched
as it<br>
were from the arduous career of their existence, while the tramp
of the<br>
advancing enemy shakes the very soil they stand on, and where it
may be<br>
doubted whether each aide-de-camp who enters comes a new votary
of pleasure<br>
or the bearer of tidings that the troops of the foe are
advancing, and<br>
already the work of death has begun: this is, indeed, a scene to
make the<br>
heart throb, and the pulse beat high; this is a moment second in
its proud<br>
excitement only to the very crash and din of battle itself. And
into this<br>
entrancing whirlwind of passion and of pleasure, of brilliant
beauty<br>
and ennobled greatness, of all that is lovely in woman and all
that is<br>
chivalrous and heroic in man, I brought a heart which, young in
years, was<br>
yet tempered by disappointment; still, such was the fascination,
such the<br>
brilliancy of the spectacle, that scarcely had I entered, than I
felt a<br>
change come over me,&mdash;the old spirit of my boyish ardor, that
high-wrought<br>
enthusiasm to do something, to be something which men may speak
of, shot<br>
suddenly through me, and I felt my cheek tingle and my temples
throb, as<br>
name after name of starred and titled officers were announced, to
think<br>
that to me, also, the path of glorious enterprise was
opening.</p>

<p>"Come along, come along," said Power, catching me by the arm,
"you've not<br>
been presented to the duchess. I know her. I'll do it for you; or
perhaps<br>
it is better Sir Thomas Picton should. In any case, <i>filez</i> after
me, for<br>
the dark-eyed senhora is surely expecting us. There, do you see
that dark,<br>
intelligent-looking fellow leaning over the end of the sofa? That
is Alava.<br>
And there, you know who that is, that <i>beau ideal</i> of a hussar?
Look how<br>
jauntily he carries himself; see the careless but graceful sling
with which<br>
he edges through the crowd; and look! Mark his bow! Did you see
that,<br>
Charley? Did you catch the quick glance he shot yonder, and the
soft smile<br>
that showed his white teeth? Depend upon it, boy, some fair heart
is not<br>
the better nor the easier for that look."</p>

<p>"Who is it?" said I.</p>

<p>"Lord Uxbridge, to be sure; the handsomest fellow in the
service; and there<br>
goes Vandeleur, talking with Vivian; the other, to the left, is
Ponsonby."</p>

<p>"But stay, Fred, tell me who that is?" For a moment or two, I
had some<br>
difficulty in directing his attention to the quarter I desired.
The<br>
individual I pointed out was somewhat above the middle size; his
uniform of<br>
blue and gold, though singularly plain, had a look of richness
about it;<br>
besides that, among the orders which covered his breast, he wore
one star<br>
of great brilliancy and size. This, however, was his least
distinction; for<br>
although surrounded on every side by those who might be deemed
the very<br>
types and pictures of their <i>caste</i>, there was something in the
easy but<br>
upright carriage of his head, the intrepid character of his
features, the<br>
bold and vigorous flashing of his deep blue eye, that marked him
as no<br>
common man. He was talking with an old and prosy-looking
personage in<br>
civilian dress; and while I could detect an anxiety to get free
from<br>
a tiresome companion, there was an air of deferential, and even
kind<br>
attention in his manner, absolutely captivating.</p>

<p>"A thorough gentleman, Fred, whoever he be," said I.</p>

<p>"I should think so," replied Power, dryly; "and as our
countrymen would<br>
say, 'The Devil thank him for it!' That is the Prince of Orange;
but see,<br>
look at him now, his features have learned another fashion." And
true it<br>
was; with a smile of the most winning softness, and with a voice,
whose<br>
slightly foreign accent took nothing from its interest, I heard
him<br>
engaging a partner for a waltz.</p>

<p>There was a flutter of excitement in the circle as the lady
rose to take<br>
his arm, and a muttered sound of, "How very beautiful, quelle est
belle,<br>
c'est un ange!" on all sides. I leaned forward to catch a glance
as she<br>
passed; it was Lucy Dashwood. Beautiful beyond anything I had
ever seen<br>
her, her lovely features lit up with pleasure and with pride, she
looked in<br>
every way worthy to lean upon the arm of royalty. The graceful
majesty of<br>
her walk, the placid loveliness of her gentle smile, struck every
one<br>
as she passed on. As for me, totally forgetting all else, not
seeing or<br>
hearing aught around me, I followed her with my eye until she was
lost<br>
among the crowd, and then, with an impulse of which I was not
master,<br>
followed in her steps.</p>

<p>"This way, this way," said Power; "I see the senhora." So
saying, we<br>
entered a little boudoir, where a party was playing at cards.
Leaning on<br>
the back of a chair, Inez was endeavoring, with that mixture of
coquetry<br>
and half malice she possessed, to distract the attention of the
player. As<br>
Power came near, she scarcely turned her head to give him a kind
of saucy<br>
smile; while, seeing me, she held out her hand with friendly
warmth, and<br>
seemed quite happy to meet me.</p>

<p>"Do, pray, take her away; get her to dance, to eat ice, or
flirt with you,<br>
for Heaven's sake!" said the half-laughing voice of her victim.
"I have<br>
revoked twice, and misdealt four times since she has been here.
Believe me,<br>
I shall take it as the greatest favor, if you'll&mdash;"</p>

<p>As he got thus far he turned round towards me, and I perceived
it was Sir<br>
George Dashwood. The meeting was as awkward for him as for me;
and while a<br>
deep flush covered my face, he muttered some unintelligible
apology, and<br>
Inez burst into a fit of laughter at the ludicrous <i>contretemps</i>
of our<br>
situation.</p>

<p>"I will dance with you now, if you like," said she, "and that
will be<br>
punishing all three. Eh, Master Fred?"</p>

<p>So saying, she took my arm as I led her toward the
ball-room.</p>

<p>"And so you really are not friends with the Dashwoods? How
very provoking,<br>
and how foolish, too! But really, Chevalier, I must say you treat
ladies<br>
very ill. I don't forget your conduct to me. Dear me, I wish we
could move<br>
forward, there is some one pushing me dreadfully!"</p>

<p>"Get on, Ma'am, get on!" said a sharp, decided voice behind
me. I turned,<br>
half smiling, to see the speaker. It was the Duke of Wellington
himself,<br>
who, with his eye fixed upon some person at a distance, seemed to
care<br>
very little for any intervening obstruction. As I made way for
him to pass<br>
between us, he looked hardly at me, while he said in a short,
quick way,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Know your face very well: how d'ye do?" With this brief
recognition he<br>
passed on, leaving me to console Inez for her crushed sleeve, by
informing<br>
her who had done it.</p>

<p>The ball was now at its height. The waltzers whirled past in
the wild<br>
excitement of the dance. The inspiriting strains of the music,
the sounds<br>
of laughter, the din, the tumult, all made up that strange medley
which,<br>
reacting upon the minds of those who cause it, increases the
feeling<br>
of pleasurable abandonment, making the old feel young, and the
young<br>
intoxicated with delight.</p>

<p>As the senhora leaned upon me, fatigued with waltzing, I was
endeavoring to<br>
sustain a conversation with her; while my thoughts were wandering
with my<br>
eyes to where I had last seen Lucy Dashwood.</p>

<p>"It must be something of importance; I'm sure it is," said
she, at the<br>
conclusion of a speech of which I had not heard one word. "Look
at General<br>
Picton's face!"</p>

<p>"Very pretty, indeed," said I; "but the hair is unbecoming,"
replying to<br>
some previous observation she had made, and still lost in a
revery. A<br>
hearty burst of laughter was her answer as she gently shook my
arm,<br>
saying,&mdash;</p>

<p>"You really are too bad! You've never listened to one word
I've been<br>
telling you, but keep continually staring with your eyes here and
there,<br>
turning this way and looking that, and with a dull, vacant, and
unmeaning<br>
smile, answering at random, in the most provoking manner. There
now, pray<br>
pay attention, and tell me what that means." As she said this,
she pointed<br>
with her fan to where a dragoon officer, in splashed and
spattered uniform,<br>
was standing talking to some three or four general officers. "But
here<br>
comes the duke; it can't be anything of consequence."</p>

<p>At the same instant the Duke of Wellington passed with the
Duchess of<br>
Richmond on his arm.</p>

<p>"No, Duchess; nothing to alarm you. Did you say ice?"</p>

<p>"There, you heard that, I hope!" said Inez; "there is nothing
to alarm us."</p>

<p>"Go to General Picton at once; but don't let it be remarked,"
said an<br>
officer, in a whisper, as he passed close by me.</p>

<p>"Inez, I have the greatest curiosity to learn what that new
arrival has to<br>
say for himself; and if you will permit me, I'll leave you with
Lady Gordon<br>
for one moment&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Delighted, of all things. You are without exception, the
most<br>
tiresome&mdash;Good-by."</p>

<p>"Sans adieu," said I, as I hurried through the crowd towards
an open<br>
window, on the balcony outside of which Sir Thomas Picton was
standing.</p>

<p>"Ah, Mr. O'Malley, have you a pencil? There, that'll do. Ride
down to<br>
Etterbeeck with this order for Godwin. You have heard the news, I
suppose,<br>
that the French are in advance? The Seventy-ninth will muster in
the Grando<br>
Place. The Ninety-second and the Twenty-eighth along the Park and
the<br>
Boulevard. Napoleon left Fresnes this morning. The Prussians have
fallen<br>
back. Zeithen has been beaten. We march at once."</p>

<p>"To-morrow, sir?"</p>

<p>"No, sir, to-night. There, don't delay! But above all, let
everything be<br>
done quietly and noiselessly. The duke will remain here for an
hour longer<br>
to prevent suspicion. When you've executed your orders, come back
here."</p>

<p>I mounted the first horse I could find at the door, and
galloped with top<br>
speed over the heavy causeway to Etterbeeck. In two minutes the
drum beat<br>
to arms, and the men were mustering as I left. Thence I hastened
to the<br>
barracks of the Highland Brigade and the 28th Regiment; and
before half an<br>
hour, was back in the ball-room, where, from the din and tumult,
I guessed<br>
the scene of pleasure and dissipation continued unabated. As I
hurried up<br>
the staircase a throng of persons were coming down, and I was
obliged to<br>
step aside to let them pass.</p>

<p>"Ah, come here, pray," said Picton, who, with a lady cloaked
and hooded<br>
leaning upon his arm, was struggling to make way through the
crowd. "The<br>
very man!"</p>

<p>"Will you excuse me if I commit you to the care of my
aide-de-camp, who<br>
will see you to your carriage? The duke has just desired to see
me." This<br>
he said in a hurried and excited tone; and the same moment
beckoned to me<br>
to take the lady's arm.</p>

<p>It was with some difficulty I succeeded in reaching the spot,
and had only<br>
time to ask whose carriage I should call for, ere we arrived in
the hall.</p>

<p>"Sir George Dashwood's," said a low, soft voice, whose accents
sank into<br>
my very heart. Heaven! it was Lucy herself; it was her arm that
leaned on<br>
mine, her locks that fluttered beside me, her hand that hung so
near, and<br>
yet I could not speak. I tried one word; but a choking feeling in
my throat<br>
prevented utterance, and already we were upon the door-steps.</p>

<p>"Sir George Dashwood's carriage," shouted the footman, and the
announcement<br>
was repeated by the porter. The steps were hurried down; the
footman stood<br>
door in hand; and I led her forward, mute and trembling. Did she
know me? I<br>
assisted her as she stepped in; her hand touched mine: it was the
work of a<br>
second; to me it was the bliss of years. She leaned a little
forward; and<br>
as the servant put up the steps, said in her soft, sweet tone,
"Thank you,<br>
sir. Good-night."</p>

<p>I felt my shoulder touched by some one who, it appeared, was
standing close<br>
to me for some seconds; but so occupied was I in gazing at her
that I paid<br>
no attention to the circumstance. The carriage drove away and
disappeared<br>
in the thick darkness of a starless night. I turned to re-enter
the house,<br>
and as I did so, the night lamp of the hall fell upon the
features of<br>
the man beside me, and showed me the pale and corpse-like face of
Fred<br>
Hammersley. His eye was bent upon me with an expression of fierce
and fiery<br>
passion, in which the sadness of long-suffering also mingled. His
bloodless<br>
lips parted, moved as though speaking, while yet no sound issued;
and his<br>
nostril, dilating and contracting by turns, seemed to denote some
deep and<br>
hidden emotion that worked within him.</p>

<p>"Hammersley," said I, holding out my hand towards
him,&mdash;"Hammersley, do not<br>
always mistake me?"</p>

<p>He shook his head mournfully as it fell forward upon his
breast, and<br>
covering his arm, moved slowly away without speaking.</p>

<p>General Picton's voice as he descended the stairs, accompanied
by Generals<br>
Vandeleur and Vivian, aroused me at once, and I hurried towards
him.</p>

<p>"Now, sir, to horse. The troops will defile by the Namur gate,
and meet me<br>
there in an hour. Meanwhile tell Colonel Cameron that he must
march with<br>
the light companies of his own and the Ninety-second at
once."</p>

<p>"I say, Picton, they'll say we were taken by surprise in
England; won't<br>
they?" said a sharp, strong voice, in a half-laughing tone from
behind.</p>

<p>"No, your Grace," said Sir Thomas, bowing slightly; "they'll
scarcely do so<br>
when they hear the time we took to get under arms."</p>

<p>I heard no more; but throwing myself into the saddle of my
troop horse,<br>
once more rode back to the Belle Vue to make ready for the
road.</p>

<p>The thin pale crescent of a new moon, across which masses of
dark and inky<br>
clouds were hurrying, tipped with its faint and sickly light the
tall<br>
minarets of the Hotel de Ville, as I rode into the Grande Place.
Although<br>
midnight, the streets were as crowded as at noonday; horse, foot,
and<br>
dragoons passing and hurrying hither; the wild pibroch of the
Highlander;<br>
the mellow bugle of the Seventy-first; the hoarse trumpet of the
cavalry;<br>
the incessant roll of the drum,&mdash;mingled their sounds with the
tide of<br>
human voices, in which every accent was heard, from the reckless
cheer of<br>
anticipated victory, to the heart-piercing shriek of woman's
agony. Lights<br>
gleamed from every window; from the doors of almost every house
poured<br>
forth a crowd of soldiers and townsfolk. The sergeants, on one
side,<br>
might be seen telling off their men, their cool and steady
countenances<br>
evidencing no semblance of emotion; while near them some young
ensign,<br>
whose beardless cheek and vacant smile bespoke the mere boy,
looked on with<br>
mingled pride and wonder at the wild scene before him. Every now
and then<br>
some general officer with his staff came cantering past; and as
the efforts<br>
to muster and form the troops grew more pressing, I could mark
how soon we<br>
were destined to meet the enemy.</p>

<p>There are few finer monuments of the architecture of the
Middle Ages than<br>
the Grande Place of Brussels,&mdash;the rich fa&ccedil;ade of the
H&ocirc;tel de Ville, with<br>
its long colonnade of graceful arches, upon every keystone of
which some<br>
grim, grotesque head is peering; the massive cornices; the heavy
corbels<br>
carved into ten thousand strange and uncouth fancies; but finer
than all,<br>
the taper and stately spire, fretted and perforated like some
piece of<br>
silver filigree, stretches upward towards the sky, its airy
pinnacle<br>
growing finer and more beautiful as it nears the stars it points
to.<br>
How full of historic associations is every dark embrasure, every
narrow<br>
casement around! Here may have stood the great emperor, Charles
the Fifth,<br>
meditating upon that greatness he was about to forego forever;
here from<br>
this tall window, may have looked the sad and sickly features of
Jeanne<br>
Laffolle, as with wandering eye and idiot smile she gazed upon
the gorgeous<br>
procession beneath. There is not a stone that has not echoed to
the tread<br>
of haughty prince or bold baron; yet never, in the palmiest days
of ancient<br>
chivalry, did those proud dwellings of the great of old look out
upon a<br>
braver and more valiant host than now thronged beneath their
shadow. It was<br>
indeed a splendid sight, where the bright gleams of torch and
lantern threw<br>
the red light around, to watch the measured tread and steady
tramp of the<br>
Highland regiments as they defiled into the open space; each
footstep as it<br>
met the ground, seeming in its proud and firm tread, to move in
more than<br>
sympathy with the wild notes of their native mountains; silent
and still<br>
they moved along; no voice spoke within their ranks, save that of
some<br>
command to "Close up&mdash;take ground&mdash;to the right&mdash;rear rank&mdash;close
order."<br>
Except such brief words as these, or the low muttered praise of
some<br>
veteran general as he rode down the line, all was orderly and
steady as<br>
on a parade. Meanwhile, from an angle of the square, the band of
an<br>
approaching regiment was heard; and to the inspiriting quickness
of "The<br>
Young May Moon," the gallant Twenty-eighth came forward and took
up their<br>
ground opposite to the Highlanders.</p>

<p>The deep bell of the H&ocirc;tel de Ville tolled one. The
solemn sound rang out<br>
and died away in many an echo, leaving upon the heart a sense of
some<br>
unknown depression; and there was something like a knell in the
deep<br>
cadence of its bay; and over many a cheek a rapid trace of gloomy
thought<br>
now passed; and true&mdash;too true, alas!&mdash;how many now listened for
the last<br>
time!</p>

<p>"March! march!" passed from front to rear; and as the bands
burst forth<br>
again in streams of spirit-stirring harmony, the Seventy-ninth
moved on;<br>
the Twenty-eighth followed; and as they debouched from the
"Place" the<br>
Seventy-first and the Ninety-second succeeded them. Like wave
after wave,<br>
the tide of armed men pressed on, and mounted the steep and
narrow street<br>
towards the upper town of Brussels. Here Pack's Brigade was
forming in the<br>
Place Royale; and a crowd of staff officers dictating orders, and
writing<br>
hurriedly on the drum-heads, were also seen. A troop of dragoons
stood<br>
beside their horses at the door of the Belle Vue, and several
grooms with<br>
led horses walked to and fro.</p>

<p>"Ride forward, sir, to the Bois de Cambre," said Picton, "and
pivot the<br>
troops on the road to Mont St. Jean. You will then wait for my
coming up,<br>
or further orders."</p>

<p>This command, which was given to me, I hastened to obey; and
with<br>
difficulty forcing my way through the opposing crowd, at length
reached the<br>
Namur gate. Here I found a detachment of the Guards, who as yet
had got no<br>
orders to march, and were somewhat surprised to learn the forward
movement.<br>
Ten minutes' riding brought me to the angle of the wood, whence I
wrote a<br>
few lines to my host of the Belle Vue, desiring him to send Mike
after me<br>
with my horses and my kit. The night was cold, dark, and
threatening; the<br>
wind howled with a low and wailing cry through the dark
pine-trees; and as<br>
I stood alone and in solitude, I had time to think of the
eventful hours<br>
before me, and of that field which ere long was to witness the
triumph or<br>
the downfall of my country's arms. The road which led through the
forest of<br>
Soignies caught an additional gloom from the dark, dense woods
around. The<br>
faint moon only showed at intervals; and a lowering sky, without
a single<br>
star, stretched above us. It was an awful and a solemn thing to
hear the<br>
deep and thundering roll of that mighty column, awakening the
echoes of<br>
the silent forest as they went. So hurried was the movement that
we had<br>
scarcely any artillery, and that of the lightest calibre; but the
clash and<br>
clank of the cavalry, the heavy, monotonous tramp of infantry
were there;<br>
and as division followed after division, staff officers rode
hurriedly to<br>
and fro, pressing the eager troops still on.</p>

<p>"Move up there, Ninety-fifth. Ah, Forty-second, we've work
before us!" said<br>
Picton, as he rode up to the head of his brigade. The air of
depression<br>
which usually sat upon his careworn features now changed for a
light and<br>
laughing look, while his voice was softened and subdued into a
low and<br>
pleasing tone. Although it was midsummer, the roads were heavy
and deep<br>
with mud. For some weeks previously the weather had been rainy;
and<br>
this, added to the haste and discomfort of the night march,
considerably<br>
increased the fatigue of the troops. Notwithstanding these
disadvantages,<br>
not a murmur nor complaint was heard on any side.</p>

<p>"I'm unco glad to get a blink o' them, onyhow," said a tall,
raw-boned<br>
sergeant, who marched beside me.</p>

<p>"Faith, and may be you won't be over pleased at the expression
of their<br>
faces, when you see them," said Mike, whose satisfaction at the
prospect<br>
before him was still as great as that of any other amidst the
thousands<br>
there.</p>

<p>The day was slowly breaking, as a Prussian officer, splashed
and covered<br>
with foam, came galloping up at full speed past us. While I was
yet<br>
conjecturing what might be the intelligence he brought, Power
rode up to my<br>
side.</p>

<p>"We're in for it, Charley," said he. "The whole French army
are in march;<br>
and Blucher's aide-de-camp, who has arrived, gives the number at
one<br>
hundred and fifty thousand men. The Prussians are drawn up
between St.<br>
Amand and Sombref, and the Nassau and Dutch troops are at Quatre
Bras, both<br>
expecting to be attacked."</p>

<p>"Quatre Bras was the original rallying spot for our troops,
was it not?"<br>
said I.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes. It is that we're now marching upon; but our
Prussian friend<br>
seems to think we shall arrive too late. Strong French corps are
already at<br>
Fresnes, under the command, it is said, of Marshal Ney."</p>

<p>The great object of the British commander-in-chief was to
arrive at Quatre<br>
Bras in sufficient time to effect his junction with Blucher
before a battle<br>
should be fought. To effect this no exertion was spared: efforts
almost<br>
super-human were made; for, however prepared for a forward
movement, it was<br>
impossible to have anticipated anything until the intentions of
Napoleon<br>
became clearly manifest. While Nivelles and Charleroi were
exposed to him<br>
on one side, Namur lay open on the other; and he could either
march upon<br>
Brussels, by Mons or Halle, or, as he subsequently attempted, by
Quatre<br>
Bras and Waterloo. No sooner, however, were his intentions
unmasked, and<br>
the line of his operations manifested, than Lord Wellington, with
an energy<br>
equal to the mighty occasion that demanded it, poured down with
the whole<br>
force under his command to meet him.</p>

<p>The march was a most distressing one; upward of
three-and-twenty miles,<br>
with deep and cut-up roads, in hot, oppressive weather, in a
country almost<br>
destitute of water. Still the troops pressed forward, and by noon
came<br>
within hearing of the heavy cannonade in front, which indicated
the<br>
situation of the battle. From this time aide-de-camp followed
aide-de-camp<br>
in quick succession, who, from their scared looks and hurried
gestures,<br>
seemed to bode but ill-fortune to the cause we cared for. What
the precise<br>
situation of the rival armies might be we knew not; but we heard
the French<br>
were in overwhelming numbers; that the Dutch troops had abandoned
their<br>
position; the Hanoverians being driven back, the Duke of
Brunswick&mdash;the<br>
brave sovereign of a gallant people&mdash;fell charging at the head of
his black<br>
hussars. From one phrase which constantly met our ears, it seemed
that<br>
the Bois de Bossu was the key of the position. This had been won
and lost<br>
repeatedly by both sides; and as we neared the battle-field a
despatch<br>
hurriedly announced to Picton the importance of at once
recovering this<br>
contested point. The Ninety-fifth were ordered up to the attack.
Scarcely<br>
was the word given, when fatigue, thirst, and exhaustion were
forgotten;<br>
with one cheer the gallant regiment formed into line, and
advanced upon<br>
the wood. Meanwhile the Highland Brigade moved down towards the
right; the<br>
Royals and the Twenty-eighth debouched upon the left of the road;
and in<br>
less than half an hour after our arrival our whole force was in
action.</p>

<p>There is something appalling, to the bravest army, in coming
up to battle<br>
at the time that an overwhelming and conquering foe are carrying
victory<br>
triumphantly before them: such was our position at Quatre Bras.
Bravely and<br>
gloriously as the forces of the Prince of Orange fought, the day,
however,<br>
was not theirs. The Bois de Bossu, which opened to the enemy the
road to<br>
Brussels, was held by their tirailleurs; the valley to the right
was rode<br>
over by their mounted squadrons, who with lance and sabre carried
all<br>
before them; their dark columns pressed steadily on; and a
death-dealing<br>
artillery swept the allied ranks from flank to flank. Such was
the field<br>
when the British arrived, and throwing themselves into squares,
opposed<br>
their unaided force to the dreadful charges of the enemy. The
batteries<br>
showered down their storms of grape; Milhaud's Heavy Dragoons,
assisted by<br>
crowds of lancers, rushed upon the squares, but they stood
unbroken and<br>
undaunted, as sometimes upon three sides of their position the
infuriated<br>
horsemen of the enemy came down. Once, and once only, were the
French<br>
successful; the 42d, who were stationed amidst tall corn-fields,
were<br>
surrounded with cavalry before they knew it. The word was given
to form<br>
square; the Lancers were already among them, and fighting back to
back, the<br>
gallant Highlanders met the foe. Fresh numbers poured down upon
them, and<br>
already half the regiment was disabled and their colonel killed.
These<br>
brave fellows were rescued by the 44th, who, throwing in a
withering<br>
volley, fixed bayonets and charged. Meanwhile the 95th had won
and lost the<br>
wood, which, now in the possession of the French tirailleurs,
threatened to<br>
turn the left of our position. It was at this time that a body of
cavalry<br>
were seen standing to the left of the Enghien road, as if in
observation.<br>
An officer sent forward to reconnoitre, returned with the
intelligence that<br>
they were British troops, for he had seen their red uniforms.</p>

<p>"I can't think it, sir," said Picton. "It is hardly possible
that any<br>
regiment from Enghien could have arrived already. Ride forward,
O'Malley,<br>
and if they be our fellows, let them carry that height yonder;
there are<br>
two guns there cutting the 92d to pieces."</p>

<p>I put spurs to my horse, cleared the road at once, and dashing
across<br>
the open space to the left of the wood, rode on in the direction
of the<br>
horsemen. When I came within the distance of three hundred yards
I examined<br>
them with my glass, and could plainly detect the scarlet coats
and bright<br>
helmets. "Ha," thought I, "the 1st Dragoon Guards, no doubt."
Muttering<br>
to myself thus much, I galloped straight on; and waving my hand
as I came<br>
near, announced that I was the bearer of an order. Scarcely had I
done so,<br>
when four horsemen, dashing spurs into their steeds, plunged
hastily out<br>
from the line, and before I could speak, surrounded me. While the
foremost<br>
called out, as he flourished his sabre above his head,
"Rendez-vous!" At<br>
the same moment I was seized on each side, and led back a captive
into the<br>
hands of the enemy.</p>

<p>"We guess your mistake, Capitaine," said the French officer
before whom I<br>
was brought. "We are the regiment of Berg, and our scarlet
uniform cost us<br>
dearly enough yesterday."</p>

<p>This allusion, I afterwards learned, was in reference to a
charge by a<br>
cuirassier regiment, which, in mistaking them for English, poured
a volley<br>
into them, and killed and wounded about twenty of their
number.</p>

<br><br><br><br><p>CHAPTER LII.</p>

<p>QUATRE BRAS.</p>

<p>Those who have visited the field of Quatre Bras will remember
that on the<br>
left of the high road, and nearly at the extremity of the Bois de
Bossu,<br>
stands a large Flemish farm-house, whose high pitched roof,
pointed gables,<br>
and quaint, old-fashioned chimneys, remind one of the
architecture<br>
so frequently seen in Tenier's pictures. The house, which, with
its<br>
dependencies of stables, granaries, and out-houses, resembles a
little<br>
village, is surrounded by a large, straggling orchard of aged
fruit-trees,<br>
through which the approach from the high road leads. The interior
of this<br>
quaint dwelling, like all those of its class, is only remarkable
for a<br>
succession of small, dark, low-ceiled rooms, leading one into
another;<br>
their gloomy aspect increased by the dark oak furniture, the
heavy<br>
armories, and old-fashioned presses, carved in the grotesque
taste of the<br>
sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Those who visit it now may
mark the<br>
trace of cannon-shot here and there through the building; more
than<br>
one deep crack will attest the force of the dread artillery.
Still the<br>
traveller will feel struck with the rural peace and quietude of
the scene;<br>
the speckled oxen that stand lowing in the deep meadows; the
splash of the<br>
silvery trout as he sports in the bright stream that ripples
along over its<br>
gravelly bed; the cawing of the old rooks in the tall
beech-trees; but more<br>
than all, the happy laugh of children,&mdash;speak of the spot as one
of retired<br>
and tranquil beauty; yet when my eyes opened upon it on the
morning of the<br>
17th of June, the scene presented features of a widely different
interest.<br>
The day was breaking as the deep, full sound of the French bugles
announced<br>
the reveille. Forgetful of where I was, I sprang from my bed and
rushed to<br>
the window; the prospect before me at once recalled me to my
recollection,<br>
and I remembered that I was a prisoner. The exciting events
around left me<br>
but little time and as little inclination to think over my old
misfortunes;<br>
and I watched, with all the interest of a soldier, the movement
of the<br>
French troops in the orchard beneath. A squadron of dragoons, who
seemed to<br>
have passed the night beside their horses, lay stretched or
seated in all<br>
the picturesque groupings of a bivouac,&mdash;some already up and
stirring;<br>
others leaned half listlessly upon their elbows, and looked about
as if<br>
unwilling to believe the night was over; and some, stretched in
deep<br>
slumber, woke not with the noise and tumult around them. The room
in which<br>
I was confined looked out upon the road to Charleroi; I could
therefore<br>
see the British troops; and as the French army had fallen back
during the<br>
night, only an advanced guard maintaining the position, I was
left to my<br>
unaided conjectures as to the fortune of the preceding day of
battle. What<br>
a period of anxiety and agitation was that morning to me; what
would I<br>
not have given to learn the result of the action since the moment
of my<br>
capture! Stubborn as our resistance had been, we were evidently
getting the<br>
worst, of it; and if the Guards had not arrived in time, I knew
we must<br>
have been beaten.</p>

<p>I walked up and down my narrow room, tortured and agonized by
my doubts,<br>
now stopping to reason over the possibilities of success, now
looking from<br>
the window to try if, in the gesture and bearing of those
without, I could<br>
conjecture anything that passed. Too well I knew the vaunting
character<br>
of the French soldier, in defeat as in victory, to put much
confidence in<br>
their bearing. While, however, I watched them with an eager eye,
I heard<br>
the tramp of horsemen coming along the paved causeway. From the
moment my<br>
ear caught the sound to that of their arrival at the gate of the
orchard,<br>
but few minutes elapsed; their pace was indeed a severe one, and
as they<br>
galloped through the narrow path that led to the farm-house, they
never<br>
drew rein till they reached the porch. The party consisted of
about a dozen<br>
persons whose plumed hats bespoke them staff officers; but their
uniforms<br>
were concealed beneath their great-coats. As they came along the
picket<br>
sprang to their feet, and the guard at the door beneath presented
arms.<br>
This left no doubt upon my mind that some officer of rank was
among them,<br>
and as I knew that Ney himself commanded on the preceding day, I
thought<br>
it might be he. The sound of voices beneath informed me that the
party<br>
occupied the room under that in which I was, and although I
listened<br>
attentively I could hear nothing but the confused murmur of
persons<br>
conversing together without detecting even a word. My thoughts
now fell<br>
into another channel, and as I ruminated over my old position, I
heard the<br>
noise of the sentry at my door as he brought his musket to the
shoulder,<br>
and the next moment an officer in the uniform of the Chasseurs of
the Guard<br>
entered. Bowing politely as he advanced to the middle of the
room, he<br>
addressed me thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>"You speak French, sir?" and as I replied in the affirmative,
continued:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Will you, then, have the goodness to follow me this way?"</p>

<p>Although burning with anxiety to learn what had taken place,
yet somehow I<br>
could not bring myself to ask the question. A secret pride
mingled with my<br>
fear that all had not gone well with us, and I durst not expose
myself to<br>
hear of our defeat from the lips of an enemy. I had barely time
to ask into<br>
whose presence I was about to be ushered, when with a slight
smile of a<br>
strange meaning, he opened the door and introduced me into the
saloon.<br>
Although I had seen at least twelve or fourteen horsemen arrive,
there were<br>
but three persons in the room as I entered. One of these, who sat
writing<br>
at a small table near the window, never lifted his head on my
entrance, but<br>
continued assiduously his occupation. Another, a tall,
fine-looking man<br>
of some sixty years or upward, whose high, bald forehead and
drooping<br>
mustache, white as snow, looked in every way the old soldier of
the empire,<br>
stood leaning upon his sabre; while the third, whose stature,
somewhat<br>
below the middle size, was yet cast in a strong and muscular
mould, stood<br>
with his back to the fire, holding on his arms the skirts of a
gray surtout<br>
which he wore over his uniform; his legs were cased in the tall
<i>bottes &agrave;<br>
l'&eacute;cuy&egrave;re</i> worn by the <i>chasseur &agrave; cheval</i>,
and on his head a low cocked<br>
hat, without plume or feather, completed his costume. There was
something<br>
which, at the very moment of my entrance, struck me as uncommon
in his air<br>
and bearing, so much so that when my eyes had once rested on his
pale but<br>
placid countenance, his regular, handsome, but somewhat stern
features, I<br>
totally forgot the presence of the others and looked only at
him.</p>

<p>"What's your rank, sir?" said he, hurriedly, and with a tone
which bespoke<br>
command.</p>

<p>"I have none at present, save&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Why do you wear your epaulettes then, sir?" said he, harshly,
while from<br>
his impatient look, and hurried gesture, I saw that he put no
faith in my<br>
reply.</p>

<p>"I am an aide-de-camp to General Picton, but without
regimental rank."</p>

<p>"What was the British force under arms yesterday?"</p>

<p>"I do not feel at liberty to give you any information as to
the number or<br>
the movements of our army."</p>

<p>"<i>Diantre! Diantre!</i>" said he, slapping his boot with his
horsewhip, "do<br>
you know what you've been saying there, eh? Cambronne, you heard
him, did<br>
you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Sire, and if your Majesty would permit me to deal with
him, I would<br>
have his information, if he possess any, and that ere long,
too."</p>

<p>"Eh, <i>gaillard</i>," said he, laughing, as he pinched the old
general's ear in<br>
jest, "I believe you, with all my heart."</p>

<p>The full truth flashed upon my mind. I was in presence of the
Emperor<br>
himself. As, however, up to this moment I was unconscious of his
presence,<br>
I resolved now to affect ignorance of it throughout.</p>

<p>"Had you despatches, sir?" said he, turning towards me with a
look of stern<br>
severity. "Were any despatches found upon him when he was taken?"
This<br>
latter question was directed to the aide-de-camp who introduced
me, and who<br>
still remained at the door.</p>

<p>"No, Sire, nothing was found upon him except this locket."</p>

<p>As he said these words he placed in Napoleon's hands the
keepsake which St.<br>
Croix had left with me years before in Spain, and which, as the
reader may<br>
remember, was a miniature of the Empress Josephine.</p>

<p>The moment the Emperor threw his eyes upon it, the flush which
excitement<br>
had called into his cheek disappeared at once. He became pale as
death, his<br>
very lips as bloodless as his wan cheek.</p>

<p>"Leave me, Lefebvre; leave me, Cambronne, for a moment. I will
speak with<br>
this gentleman alone."</p>

<p>As the door closed upon them he leaned his arm upon the
mantelpiece, and<br>
with his head sunk upon his bosom, remained some moments without
speaking.</p>

<p>"Augure sinistre!" muttered he within his teeth, as his
piercing gaze was<br>
riveted upon the picture before him. "Voil&agrave; la
troisi&egrave;me fois peut-&ecirc;tre<br>
la derni&egrave;re." Then suddenly rousing himself, he advanced
close to me, and<br>
seizing me by the arm with a grasp like iron, inquired:&mdash;</p>

<p>"How came you by this picture? The truth, sir; mark me, the
truth!"</p>

<p>Without showing any sign of feeling hurt at the insinuation of
this<br>
question, I detailed, in as few words as I could, the
circumstance by which<br>
the locket became mine. Long before I had concluded, however, I
could mark<br>
that his attention flagged, and finally wandered far away from
the matter<br>
before him.</p>

<p>"Why will you not give me the information I look for? I seek
for no breach<br>
of faith. The campaign is all but over. The Prussians were beaten
at Ligny,<br>
their army routed, their artillery captured, ten thousand
prisoners taken.<br>
Your troops and the Dutch were conquered yesterday, and they are
in full<br>
retreat on Brussels. By to-morrow evening I shall date my
bulletin from<br>
the palace at Laeken. Antwerp will be in my possession within
twenty-four<br>
hours. Namur is already mine. Cambronne, Lefebvre," cried he,
"cet homme-l&agrave;<br>
n'en sait rien," pointing to me as he spoke; "let us see the
other." With<br>
this he motioned slightly with his hand as a sign for me to
withdraw, and<br>
the next moment I was once more in the solitude of my
prison-room, thinking<br>
over the singular interview I had just had with the great
Emperor.</p>

<p>How anxiously pass the hours of one who, deprived of other
means of<br>
information, is left to form his conjectures by some passing
object or some<br>
chance murmur. The things which, in the ordinary course of life,
are passed<br>
by unnoticed and unregarded, are now matters of moment,&mdash;with
what scrutiny<br>
he examines the features of those whom he dare not question; with
what<br>
patient ear he listens to each passing word. Thus to me, a
prisoner,<br>
the hours went by tardily yet anxiously; no sabre clanked; no
war-horse<br>
neighed; no heavy-booted cuirassier tramped in the courtyard
beneath my<br>
window, without setting a hundred conjectures afloat as to what
was about<br>
to happen. For some time there had been a considerable noise and
bustle in<br>
and about the dwelling. Horsemen came and went continually. The
sounds of<br>
galloping could be heard along the paved causeway; then the
challenge of<br>
the sentry at the gate; then the nearer tread of approaching
stops, and<br>
many voices speaking together, would seem to indicate that some
messenger<br>
had arrived with despatches. At length all these sounds became
hushed and<br>
still. No longer were the voices heard; and except the measured
tread of<br>
the heavy cuirassier, as he paced on the flags beneath, nothing
was to be<br>
heard. My state of suspense, doubly greater now than when the
noise and<br>
tumult suggested food for conjecture, continued till towards
noon, when<br>
a soldier in undress brought me some breakfast, and told me to
prepare<br>
speedily for the road.</p>

<p>Scarcely had he left the room, when the rumbling noise of
wagons was heard<br>
below, and a train of artillery carts moved into the little
courtyard<br>
loaded with wounded men. It was a sad and frightful sight to see
these poor<br>
fellows, as, crammed side by side in the straw of the
<i>charrette</i>, they<br>
lay, their ghastly wounds opening with every motion of the wagon,
while<br>
their wan, pale faces were convulsed with agony and suffering. Of
every<br>
rank, from the sous-lieutenant to the humble soldier, from every
arm of the<br>
service, from the heavy cuirassier of the guard to the light and
intrepid<br>
tirailleur, they were there. I well remember one, an
artillery-man of<br>
the guard, who, as they lifted him forth from the cart, presented
the<br>
horrifying spectacle of one both of whose legs had been carried
away by a<br>
cannon-shot. Pale, cold, and corpse-like, ha lay in their arms;
his head<br>
lay heavily to one side, his arms fell passively as in death. It
was at<br>
this moment a troop of lancers, the advanced guard of D'Erlon's
Division,<br>
came trotting up the road; the cry of "Vive l'Empereur!" burst
from them<br>
as they approached; its echo rang within the walls of the
farm-house, when<br>
suddenly the dying man, as though some magic touch had called him
back to<br>
life and vigor, sprang up erect between his bearers, his filmy
eye flashing<br>
fire, a burning spot of red coloring his bloodless cheek. He cast
one wild<br>
and hurried look around him, like one called back from death to
look<br>
upon the living; and as he raised his blood-stained hand above
his head,<br>
shouted, in a heart-piercing cry, "Vive l'Empereur!" The effort
was his<br>
last. It was the expiring tribute of allegiance to the chief he
adored. The<br>
blood spouted in cataracts from his half-closed wounds, a
convulsive spasm<br>
worked through his frame, his eyes rolled fearfully, as his
outstretched<br>
hands seemed striving to clutch some object before them, and he
was dead.<br>
Fresh arrivals of wounded continued to pour in; and now I thought
I could<br>
detect at intervals the distant noise of a cannonade. The wind,
however,<br>
was from the southward, and the sounds were too indistinct to be
relied on.</p>

<p>"Allons, aliens, mon cher!" said a rough but good-humored
looking fellow,<br>
as he strode into my room. He was the quartermaster of Milhaud's
Dragoons,<br>
under whose care I was now placed, and came to inform me that we
were to<br>
set out immediately.</p>

<p>Monsieur Bonnard was a character in his way; and if it were
not so near the<br>
conclusion of my history, I should like to present him to my
readers. As<br>
it is, I shall merely say he was a thorough specimen of one class
of<br>
his countrymen,&mdash;a loud talker, a louder swearer, a vaporing,
boasting,<br>
overbearing, good-natured, and even soft-hearted fellow, who
firmly<br>
believed that Frenchmen were the climax of the species, and
Napoleon the<br>
climax of Frenchmen. Being a great <i>bavard</i>, he speedily told me
all that<br>
had taken place during the last two days. From him I learned that
the<br>
Prussians had really been beaten at Ligny, and had fallen back,
he knew<br>
not where. They were, however, he said, hotly pursued by Grouchy,
with<br>
thirty-five thousand men, while the Emperor himself was now
following the<br>
British and Dutch armies with seventy thousand more.</p>

<p>"You see," continued he, "l'affaire est faite! Who can resist
the Emperor?"</p>

<p>These were sad tidings for me; and although I did not place
implicit<br>
confidence in my informant, I had still my fears that much of
what he said<br>
was true.</p>

<p>"And the British, now," said I, "what direction have they
taken?"</p>

<p>"Bah, they're in retreat on Brussels, and will probably
capitulate<br>
to-morrow."</p>

<p>"Capitulate!"</p>

<p>"Oui, oui; ne vous f&acirc;chez pas, camarade," said he,
laughing. "What could<br>
you do against Napoleon? You did not expect to beat him, surely?
But come,<br>
we must move on; I have my orders to bring you to Planchenoit
this evening,<br>
and our horses are tired enough already."</p>

<p>"Mine, methinks, should be fresh," said I.</p>

<p>"<i>Parbleu, mon!</i>" replied he; "he has twice made the journey
to Fresnes<br>
this morning with despatches for Marshal Ney; the Emperor is
enraged<br>
with the marshal for having retreated last night, having the wood
in his<br>
possession; he says he should have waited till daybreak, and then
fallen<br>
upon your retreating columns. As it is, you are getting away
without much<br>
loss. <i>Sacristie</i>, that was a fine charge!" These last words he
muttered to<br>
himself, adding, between his teeth, "Sixty-four killed and
wounded."</p>

<p>"What was that? Who were they?" said I.</p>

<p>"Our fellows," replied he, frankly; "the Emperor ordered up
two<br>
twelve-pounders, and eight squadrons of lancers; they fell upon
your light<br>
dragoons in a narrow part of the high road. But suddenly we heard
a noise<br>
in front; your hussars fell back, and a column of your heavy
dragoons came<br>
thundering down upon us. <i>Parbleu!</i> they swept over us as if we
were broken<br>
infantry; and there! there!" said he, pointing to the courtyard,
from<br>
whence the groans of the wounded still rose,&mdash;"there are the
fruits of that<br>
terrible charge."</p>

<p>I could not restrain an outbreak of triumphant pleasure at
this gallant<br>
feat of my countrymen.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," said the honest quartermaster; "it was a fine
thing; but a<br>
heavy reckoning is at hand. But come, now, let us take the
road."</p>

<p>In a few moments more I found myself seated upon a heavy
Norman horse,<br>
whose lumbering demi-peak saddle was nearly cleft in two by a
sabre-cut.</p>

<p>"Ay, ay," said Monsieur Bonnard, as he saw my eye fixed on the
spot, "it<br>
was one of your fellows did that; and the same cut clove poor
Pierre from<br>
the neck to the seat."</p>

<p>"I hope," said I, laughing, "the saddle may not prove an
unlucky one."</p>

<p>"No, no," said the Frenchman, seriously; "it has paid its debt
to fate."</p>

<p>As we pressed on our road, which, broken by the heavy guns,
and ploughed up<br>
in many places by the artillery, was nearly impassable, we could
distinctly<br>
hear from time to time the distant boom of the large guns, as the
retiring<br>
and pursuing armies replied to each other; while behind us, but
still a<br>
long way off, a dark mass appeared on the horizon: they were the
advancing<br>
columns of Ney's Division.</p>

<p>"Have the troops come in contact more than once this
morning?"</p>

<p>"Not closely," said the quartermaster; "the armies have kept a
respectful<br>
distance; they were like nothing I can think of," said the
figurative<br>
Frenchman, "except two hideous serpents wallowing in mire, and
vomiting at<br>
each other whole rivers of fire and flame."</p>

<p>As we approached Planchenoit, we came up to the rear-guard of
the French<br>
army; from them we learned that Ney's Division, consisting of the
Eighth<br>
Corps, had joined the Emperor; that the British were still in
retreat, but<br>
that nothing of any importance had occurred between the rival
armies, the<br>
French merely firing their heavy guns from time to time to
ascertain by<br>
the reply the position of the retreating forces. The rain poured
down in<br>
torrents; gusts of cold and stormy wind swept across the wide
plains, or<br>
moaned sorrowfully through the dense forest. As I rode on by the
side of my<br>
companion, I could not help remarking how little the effects of a
fatiguing<br>
march and unfavorable weather were apparent on those around me.
The spirit<br>
of excited gayety pervaded every rank; and unlike the stern
features which<br>
the discipline of our service enforces, the French soldiers were
talking,<br>
laughing and even singing, as they marched; the canteens passed
freely from<br>
hand to hand, and jests and toasts flew from front to rear along
the dark<br>
columns; many carried their loaves of dark rye-bread on the tops
of their<br>
bayonets; and to look upon that noisy and tumultuous mass as they
poured<br>
along, it would have needed a practised eye to believe them the
most<br>
disciplined of European armies.</p>

<p>The sun was just setting, as mounting a ridge of high land
beside the high<br>
road, my companion pointed with his finger to a small farm-house,
which,<br>
standing alone in the plain, commands an extensive view on every
side of<br>
it.</p>

<p>"There," said he,&mdash;"there is the <i>quartier
g&eacute;n&eacute;ral</i>; the Emperor sleeps<br>
there to-night. The King of Holland will afford him a bed
to-morrow night."</p>

<p>The dark shadows of the coming night were rapidly falling as I
strained my<br>
eyes to trace the British position. A hollow, rumbling sound
announced the<br>
movement of artillery in our front.</p>

<p>"What is it, Arnotte?" said the quartermaster to a dragoon
officer who rode<br>
past.</p>

<p>"It is nothing," replied the other, laughing, "but a <i>ruse</i> of
the Emperor.<br>
He wishes to ascertain if the enemy are in force, or if we have
only a<br>
strong rear-guard before us."</p>

<p>As he spoke fifteen heavy guns opened there fire, and the
still air<br>
reverberated with a loud thunder. The sound had not died away,
the very<br>
smoke lay yet heavily upon the moist earth, when forty pieces of
British<br>
cannon rang out their answer, and the very plain trembled beneath
the<br>
shock.</p>

<p>"Ha, they are there, then!" exclaimed the dragoon, as his eyes
flashed with<br>
ecstasy. "Look! see! the artillery are limbering up already. The
Emperor is<br>
satisfied."</p>

<p>And so it was. A dark column of twelve hundred horse that
accompanied the<br>
guns into the plain, now wheeled slowly round, and wound their
long track<br>
far away to the right. The rain fell in torrents; the wind was
hushed;<br>
and as the night fell in darkness, the columns moved severally to
their<br>
destinations. The bivouacs were formed; the watch-fires were
lighted; and<br>
seventy thousand men and two hundred pieces of cannon occupied
the heights<br>
of Planchenoit.</p>

<p>"My orders are to bring you to La Caillon," said the
quartermaster; "and if<br>
you only can spur your jaded horse into a trot, we shall soon
reach it."</p>

<p>About a hundred yards from the little farm-house, stood a
small cottage of<br>
a peasant. Here some officers of Marshal Soult's staff had taken
up their<br>
quarters; and thither my guide now bent his steps.</p>

<p>"Comment, Bonnard!" said an aide-de-camp, as we rode up.
"Another prisoner?<br>
<i>Sacrebleu!</i> We shall have the whole British staff among us. You
are<br>
in better luck than your countryman, the general, I hope," said
the<br>
aide-decamp. "His is a sad affair; and I'm sorry for it, too.
He's a fine,<br>
soldier-like looking fellow."</p>

<p>"Pray, what has happened?" said I. "To what do you
allude?"</p>

<p>"Merely to one of your people who has just been taken with
some letters and<br>
papers of Bourmont's in his possession. The Emperor is in no very
amicable<br>
humor towards the traitor, and resolves to pay off some part of
his debt on<br>
his British correspondent."</p>

<p>"How cruel! How unjust!"</p>

<p>"Why, yes, it is hard, I confess, to be shot for the fault of
another.<br>
Mais, que voulez-vous?"</p>

<p>"And when is this atrocious act to take place?"</p>

<p>"By daybreak to-morrow," said he, bowing, as he turned towards
the hut.<br>
"Meanwhile, let me counsel you, if you would not make another in
the party,<br>
to reserve your indignation for your return to England."</p>

<p>"Come along," said the quartermaster; "I find they have got
quarters for<br>
you in the granary of the farm. I'll not forget you at
supper-time."</p>

<p>So saying, he gave his horse to an orderly, and led me by a
little path<br>
to a back entrance of the dwelling. Had I time or inclination for
such a<br>
scene, I might have lingered long to gaze at the spectacle before
me. The<br>
guard held their bivouac around the quarters of the Emperor; and
here,<br>
beside the watch-fires, sat the bronzed and scarred veterans who
had braved<br>
every death and danger, from the Pyramids to the Kremlin. On
every side I<br>
heard the names of those whom history has already consigned to
immortality;<br>
and as the fitful blaze of a wood-fire flashed from within the
house, I<br>
could mark the figure of one who, with his hands behind his back,
walked<br>
leisurely to and fro, his head leaned a little forward as though
in deep<br>
thought; but as the light fell upon his pale and placid features,
there was<br>
nothing there to indicate the stormy strife of hope and fear that
raged<br>
beneath. From the rapid survey I took around I was roused by an
officer,<br>
who, saluting me, politely desired me to follow him. We mounted a
flight of<br>
stone steps which, outside the wall of the building, led to the
upper story<br>
of a large but ruined granary. Here a sentry was posted, who
permitting us<br>
to pass forward, I found myself in a small, mean-looking
apartment, whose<br>
few articles of coarse furniture were dimly lighted by the feeble
glimmer<br>
of a lamp. At the farther end of the room sat a man wrapped in a
large blue<br>
cavalry cloak, whose face, covered with his hands as he bent
downward,<br>
was completely concealed from view. The noise of the opening door
did not<br>
appear to arouse him, nor did he notice my approach. As I
entered, a faint<br>
sigh broke from him, as he turned his back upon the light; but he
spoke not<br>
a word.</p>

<p>I sat for some time in silence, unwilling to obtrude myself
upon the<br>
sorrows of one to whom I was unknown; and as I walked up and down
the<br>
gloomy chamber, my thoughts became riveted so completely upon my
own<br>
fortunes that I ceased to remember my fellow-prisoner. The hours
passed<br>
thus lazily along, when the door suddenly opened, and an officer
in the<br>
dress of a lancer of the guard stood for an instant before me,
and then,<br>
springing forward, clasped me by both hands, and called
out,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Charles, mon ami, c'est bien toi?"</p>

<p>The voice recalled to my recollections what his features,
altered by time<br>
and years, had failed to do. It was Jules St. Croix, my former
prisoner in<br>
the Peninsula. I cannot paint the delight with which I saw him
again; his<br>
presence now, while it brought back the memory of some of my
happiest days,<br>
also assured me that I was not friendless.</p>

<p>His visit was a brief one, for he was in attendance on Marshal
Lobau's<br>
staff. In the few minutes, however, of his stay, he said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"I have a debt to pay, Charles, and have come to discharge it.
In an hour<br>
hence I shall leave this with despatches for the left of our
line. Before<br>
I go, I'll come here with two or three others, as it were, to
wish you a<br>
good-night. I'll take care to carry a second cloak and a foraging
cap; I'll<br>
provide a fast horse; you shall accompany us for some distance.
I'll see<br>
you safe across our pickets; for the rest, you must trust to
yourself.<br>
C'est arrang&eacute;, n'est-ce-pas?"</p>

<p>One firm grasp of his hand, to which I responded by another,
followed, and<br>
he was gone.</p>

<p>Everything concurred to show me that a tremendous battle must
ensue on the<br>
morrow, if the British forces but held their position. It was,
then, with a<br>
feeling of excitement approaching to madness that I saw my
liberty before<br>
me; that once more I should join in the bold charge and the rude
shock<br>
of arms, hear the wild cry of my gallant countrymen, and either
live to<br>
triumph with them in victory, or wait not to witness our defeat.
Fast flew<br>
my hopes, as with increasing impatience I waited St. Croix's
coming, and<br>
with anxious heart listened to every sound upon the stairs which
might<br>
indicate his approach. At length he came. I heard the gay and
laughing<br>
voices of his companions as they came along; the door opened, and
affecting<br>
the familiarity of old acquaintance to deceive the sentry, they
all shook<br>
me by the hand and spoke in terms of intimacy.</p>

<p>"Labedoy&egrave;re is below," said St. Croix, in a whisper;
"you must wait here a<br>
few moments longer, and I'll return for you; put on the cloak and
cap, and<br>
speak not a word as you pass out. The sentry will suppose that
one of our<br>
party has remained behind; for I shall call out as if speaking to
him, as I<br>
leave the room."</p>

<p>The voice of an officer calling in tones of impatience for the
party<br>
to come down, cut short the interview; and again assuring me of
their<br>
determination to stand by me, they left the chamber and descended
into the<br>
court. Scarcely had the door closed behind them, when my
fellow-prisoner,<br>
whom I had totally forgotten, sprang on his legs and came towards
me. His<br>
figure screening the lamplight as he stood, prevented my
recognizing his<br>
features, but the first tones of his voice told me who he
was.</p>

<p>"Stay, sir," cried he, as he placed his hand upon my arm; "I
have overheard<br>
your project. In an hour hence you will be free. Can you&mdash;-will
you perform<br>
a service for one who will esteem it not the less that it will be
the last<br>
that man can render him? The few lines which I have written here
with my<br>
pencil are for my daughter."</p>

<p>I could bear no more, and called out in a voice broken as his
own,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh, be not deceived, sir. Will you, even in an hour like
this, accept a<br>
service from one whom you have banished from your house?"</p>

<p>The old man started as I spoke; his hand trembled till it
shook my very<br>
arm, and after a pause and with an effort to seem calm and
collected, he<br>
added,&mdash;</p>

<p>"My hours are few. Some despatches of General Bourmont with
which the duke<br>
intrusted me were found in my possession. My sentence is a
hurried one, and<br>
it is death. By to-morrow's sunrise&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Stay, stay!" said I. "You shall escape; my life is in no
danger. I have,<br>
as you see, even friends among the staff. Besides, I have done
nothing to<br>
compromise or endanger my position."</p>

<p>"No, sir," said he, sternly, "I will not act such a part as
this. The tears<br>
you have seen in these old eyes are not for myself. I fear not
death.<br>
Better it were it should have come upon the field of glorious
battle; but<br>
as it is, my soldier's honor is intact, untainted."</p>

<p>"You refuse the service on account of him who proffers it,"
said I, as I<br>
fell heavily upon a seat, my head bowed upon my bosom.</p>

<p>"Not so, not so, my boy," replied he, kindly. "The near
approach of death,<br>
like the fading light of day, gives us a longer and a clearer
view before<br>
us. I feel that I have wronged you; that I have imputed to you
the errors<br>
of others; but, believe me, if I have wronged you, I have
punished my own<br>
heart; for, Charles, I have loved you like a son."</p>

<p>"Then prove it," said I, "and let me act towards you as
towards a father.<br>
You will not? You refuse me still? Then, by Heaven, I remain to
share your<br>
fate! I well know the temper of him who has sentenced you, and
that, by one<br>
word of mine, my destiny is sealed forever."</p>

<p>"No, no, boy! This is but rash and insane folly. Another year
or two, nay,<br>
perhaps a few months more, and in the common course of Nature I
had ceased<br>
to be; but you, with youth, with fortune, and with hope&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, not with hope!" said I, in a voice of agony.</p>

<p>"Nay, say not so," replied he, calmly, while a sickly smile
played sadly<br>
over his face; "you will give this letter to my daughter, you
will tell her<br>
that we parted as friends should part; and if after that, when
time shall<br>
have smoothed down her grief, and her sorrow be rather a dark
dream of the<br>
past than a present suffering,&mdash;if then you love her, and
if&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, tempt me not thus!" said I, as the warm tears gushed from
my eyes.<br>
"Lead me not thus astray from what my honor tells me I should do.
Hark!<br>
They are coming already. I hear the clank of their sabres; they
are<br>
mounting the steps; not a moment is to be lost! Do you refuse me
still?"</p>

<p>"I do," replied he, firmly; "I am resolved to bide my
fate."</p>

<p>"Then so do I," cried I, as folding my arms, I sat down beside
the window,<br>
determined on my course.</p>

<p>"Charley, Charley," said he, stooping over me, "my friend, my
last hope,<br>
the protector of my child&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I will not go," said I, in a hollow whisper.</p>

<p>Already they were at the door; I heard their voices as they
challenged the<br>
sentry; I heard his musket as he raised it to his shoulder. The
thought<br>
flashed across me. I jumped up, and throwing the loose mantle of
the French<br>
dragoon around him, and replacing his own with the foraging cap
of St.<br>
Croix, I sprang into a corner of the room, and seating myself so
as to<br>
conceal my face, waited the result. The door opened, the party
entered<br>
laughing and talking together.</p>

<p>"Come, Eug&egrave;ne," said one, taking Sir George by the arm,
"you have spent<br>
long enough time here to learn the English language. We shall be
late at<br>
the outpost. Messieurs les Anglais, good-night, good-night!"</p>

<p>This was repeated by the others as they passed out with Sir
George Dashwood<br>
among them, who, seeing that my determination was not to be
shaken, and<br>
that any demur on his part must necessarily compromise both,
yielded to a<br>
<i>coup-de-main</i> what he never would have consented to from an
appeal to his<br>
reason. The door closed; their steps died away in the distance.
Again a<br>
faint sound struck my ear; it was the challenge of the sentry
beneath,<br>
and I heard the tramp of horses' feet. All was still, and in a
burst of<br>
heart-felt gratitude I sank upon my knees, and thanked God that
he was<br>
safe.</p>

<p>So soundly did I sleep, that not before I was shaken several
times by the<br>
shoulder could I awake on the following morning.</p>

<p>"I thought there were two prisoners here," said a gruff voice,
as an old<br>
mustached-looking veteran cast a searching look about the room.
"However,<br>
we shall have enough of them before sunset. Get&mdash;get up; Monsieur
le Duc de<br>
Dalmatie desires some information you can give him."</p>

<p>As he said this, he led me from the room; and descending the
flight of<br>
stone steps, we entered the courtyard. It was but four o'clock,
the rain,<br>
still falling in torrents, yet every one was up and stirring.</p>

<p>"Mount this horse," said my gruff friend, "and come with me
towards the<br>
left; the marshal has already gone forward."</p>

<p>The heavy mist of the morning, darkened by the lowering clouds
which almost<br>
rested on the earth, prevented our seeing above a hundred yards
before<br>
us; but the hazy light of the watch-fires showed me extent of the
French<br>
position, as it stretched away along the, ridge towards the Halle
road. We<br>
rode forward at a trot, but in the deep clayey soil we sank at
each moment<br>
to our horses' fetlocks. I turned my head as I heard the tramp
and splash<br>
of horsemen behind, and perceived that I was followed by two
dragoons,<br>
who, with their carbines on the rest, kept their eyes steadily
upon me to<br>
prevent any chance of escape. In a slight hollow of the ground
before us<br>
stood a number of horsemen, who conversed together in a low tone
as we came<br>
up.</p>

<p>"There, that is the marshal," said my companion, in a whisper,
as we joined<br>
the party.</p>

<p>"Yes, Monsieur le Duc," said an engineer colonel, who stood
beside Soult's<br>
horse with a colored plan in his hand,&mdash;"yes, that is the
Ch&acirc;teau de<br>
Goumont, yonder. It is, as you perceive, completely covered by
the rising<br>
ground marked here. They will doubtless place a strong artillery
force in<br>
this quarter."</p>

<p>"Ah, who is this?" said the marshal, turning his eyes suddenly
upon me, and<br>
then casting a look of displeasure around him, lest I should have
overheard<br>
any portion of their conversation. "You are deficient in cavalry,
it would<br>
appear, sir," said he to me.</p>

<p>"You must feel, Monsieur le Duc," said I, calmly, "how
impossible it is for<br>
me, as a man of honor and a soldier, to afford you any
information as to<br>
the army I belong to."</p>

<p>"I do not see that, sir. You are a prisoner in our hands; your
treatment,<br>
your fortune, your very life depends on us. Besides, sir, when
French<br>
officers fall into the power of your people, I have heard they
meet with no<br>
very ceremonious treatment."</p>

<p>"Those who say so, say falsely," said I, "and wrong both your
countrymen<br>
and mine. In any case&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The Guards are an untried force in your service," said he,
with a mixture<br>
of inquiry and assertion.</p>

<p>I replied not a word.</p>

<p>"You must see, sir," continued he, "that all the chances are
against you.<br>
The Prussians beaten, the Dutch discouraged, the Belgians only
waiting for<br>
victory to incline to our standard, to desert your ranks and pass
over to<br>
ours; while your troops, scarcely forty thousand,&mdash;nay, I might
say, not<br>
more than thirty-five thousand. Is it not so?"</p>

<p>Here was another question so insidiously conveyed that even a
change of<br>
feature on my part might have given the answer. A half smile,
however, and<br>
a slight bow was all my reply; while Soult muttered something
between his<br>
teeth, which called forth a laugh from those around him.</p>

<p>"You may retire, sir, a little," said he, dryly, to me.</p>

<p>Not sorry to be freed from the awkwardness of my position, I
fell back to<br>
the little rising ground behind. Although the rain poured down
without<br>
ceasing, the rising sun dispelled, in part, the heavy vapor, and
by degrees<br>
different portions of the wide plain presented themselves to
view; and<br>
as the dense masses of fog moved slowly along, I could detect,
but still<br>
faintly, the outline of the large, irregular building which I had
heard<br>
them call the Ch&acirc;teau de Goumont, and from whence I could
hear the clank of<br>
masonry, as, at intervals, the wind bore the sounds towards me.
These were<br>
the sappers piercing the walls for musketry; and this I could now
perceive<br>
was looked upon as a position of no small importance. Surrounded
by a<br>
straggling orchard of aged fruit-trees, the ch&acirc;teau lay
some hundred yards<br>
in advance of the British line, commanded by two eminences,&mdash;one
of which,<br>
in the possession of the French, was already occupied by a park
of eleven<br>
guns; of the other I knew nothing, except the passing glance I
had obtained<br>
of its position on the map. The Second Corps, under Jerome
Bonaparte, with<br>
Foy and Kellermann's Brigade of light artillery, stretched behind
us. On<br>
the right of these came D'Erlon's Corps, extending to a small
wood, which<br>
my companion told me was Frischermont; while Lobau's Division was
stationed<br>
to the extreme right towards St. Lambert, to maintain the
communication<br>
with Grouchy at Wavre, or, if need be, to repel the advance of
the<br>
Prussians and prevent their junction with the Anglo-Dutch army.
The<br>
Imperial Guard, with the cavalry, formed the reserve. Such was,
in<br>
substance, the information given me by my guide, who seemed to
expatiate<br>
with pleasure over the magnificent array of battle, while he felt
a pride<br>
in displaying his knowledge of the various divisions and their
leaders.</p>

<p>"I see the marshal moving towards the right," said he; "we had
better<br>
follow him."</p>

<p>It was now about eight o'clock as from the extremity of the
line I could<br>
see a party of horsemen advancing at a sharp canter.</p>

<p>"That must be Ney," said my companion. "See how rashly he
approaches the<br>
English lines!"</p>

<p>And so it was. The party in question rode fearlessly down the
slope, and<br>
did not halt until they reached within about three hundred yards
of what<br>
appeared a ruined church.</p>

<p>"What is that building yonder?"</p>

<p>"That&mdash;that," replied he, after a moment's thought,&mdash;"that
must be La Haye<br>
Sainte; and yonder, to the right of it, is the road to Brussels.
There,<br>
look now! Your people are in motion. See, a column is moving
towards the<br>
right, and the cavalry are defiling on the other side of the
road! I was<br>
mistaken, that cannot be Ney. <i>Sacre Dieu!</i> it was the Emperor
himself, and<br>
here he comes."</p>

<p>As he spoke, the party galloped forward and pulled up short
within a few<br>
yards of where we stood.</p>

<p>"Ha!" cried he, as his sharp glance fell upon me, "there is my
taciturn<br>
friend of Quatre Bras. You see, sir, I can dispense with your
assistance<br>
now; the chess-board is before me;" and then added, in a tone he
intended<br>
not to be overheard, "Everything depends on Grouchy."</p>

<p>"Well, Haxo," he called out to an officer who galloped up,
<i>chapeau</i> in<br>
hand, "what say you? Are they intrenched in that position?"</p>

<p>"No, Sire, the ground is open, and in two hours more will be
firm enough<br>
for the guns to manoeuvre."</p>

<p>"Now, then, for breakfast," said Napoleon, as with an easy and
tranquil<br>
smile he turned his horse's head and cantered gently up the
heights<br>
towards La Belle Alliance. As he approached the lines, the cry of
"Vive<br>
l'Empereur!" burst forth. Regiment after regiment took it up; and
from the<br>
distant wood of Frischermont to the far left beside Merke-braine,
the<br>
shout resounded. So sudden, so simultaneous the outbreak, that he
himself,<br>
accustomed as he well was to the enthusiasm of his army, seemed
as he<br>
reined in his horse, and looked with proud and elated eye upon
the<br>
countless thousands, astounded and amazed. He lifted with slow
and graceful<br>
action his unplumed hat above his head, and while he bowed that
proud front<br>
before which kings have trembled, the acclamation burst forth
anew, and<br>
rent the very air.</p>

<p>At this moment the sun shone brilliantly from out the dark
clouds, and<br>
flashed upon the shining blades and glistening bayonets along the
line. A<br>
dark and lowering shadow hung gloomily over the British position,
while the<br>
French sparkled and glittered in the sunbeams. His quick glance
passed with<br>
lightning speed from one to the other; and I thought that, in his
look,<br>
upturned to heaven, I could detect the flitting thought which
bade him hope<br>
it was an augury. The bands of the Imperial Guard burst forth in
joyous and<br>
triumphant strains; and amidst the still repeated cries of
"L'Empereur!<br>
l'Empereur!" he rode slowly along towards La Belle Alliance.</p>

<br><br><br><br><p>CHAPTER LIII.</p>

<p>WATERLOO.</p>

<p>Napoleon's first intention was to open the battle by an attack
upon the<br>
extreme right; but Ney, who returned from an observation of the
ground,<br>
informed him that a rivulet swollen by the late rains had now
become a<br>
foaming torrent perfectly impassable to infantry. To avoid this
difficulty<br>
he abandoned his favorite manoeuvre of a flank movement, and
resolved to<br>
attack the enemy by the centre. Launching his cavalry and
artillery by the<br>
road to Brussels, he hoped thus to cut off the communication of
the British<br>
with their own left, as well as with the Prussians, for whom he
trusted<br>
that Grouchy would be more than a match.</p>

<p>The reserves were in consequence all brought up to the centre.
Seven<br>
thousand cavalry and a massive artillery assembled upon the
heights of La<br>
Belle Alliance, and waited but the order to march. It was eleven
o'clock,<br>
and Napoleon mounted his horse and rode slowly along the line;
again the<br>
cry of "Vive l'Empereur!" resounded, and the bands of the various
regiments<br>
struck up their spirit-stirring strains as the gorgeous staff
moved along.<br>
On the British side all was tranquil; and still the different
divisions<br>
appeared to have taken up their ground, and the long ridge from
Ter-la-Haye<br>
to Merke-braine bristled with bayonets. Nothing could possibly be
more<br>
equal than the circumstances of the field. Each army possessed an
eminence<br>
whence their artillery might play. A broad and slightly
undulating valley<br>
lay between both. The ground permitted in all places both cavalry
and<br>
infantry movements, and except the crumbling walls of the
Ch&acirc;teau of<br>
Hougoumont. or the farm-house of La Haye Sainte, both of which
were<br>
occupied by the British, no advantage either by Nature or art
inclined to<br>
either side. It was a fair stand-up fight. It was the mighty
tournament,<br>
not only of the two greatest nations, but the two deadliest
rivals and<br>
bitterest enemies, led on by the two greatest military geniuses
that the<br>
world has ever seen; it might not be too much to say, or ever
will see.<br>
As for me, condemned to be an inactive spectator of the mighty
struggle,<br>
doomed to witness all the deep-laid schemes and well-devised
plans of<br>
attack which were destined for the overthrow of my country's
arms, my state<br>
was one of torture and suspense. I sat upon the little rising
ground of<br>
Rossomme; before me in the valley, where yet the tall corn waved
in ripe<br>
luxuriance, stood the quiet and peaceful-looking old
Ch&acirc;teau of Hougoumont,<br>
and the blossoming branches of the orchard; the birds were gayly
singing<br>
their songs; the shrill whistle of the fatal musketry was to be
heard; and<br>
through my glass I could detect the uniform of the soldiers who
held the<br>
position, and my heart beat anxiously and proudly as I recognized
the<br>
Guards. In the orchard and the garden were stationed some
riflemen,&mdash;at<br>
least their dress and the scattered order they assumed bespoke
them such.<br>
While I looked, the tirailleurs of Jerome's Division advanced
from the<br>
front of the line, and descending the hill in a sling trot, broke
into<br>
scattered parties, keeping up as they went a desultory and
irregular fire.<br>
The English skirmishers, less expert in this peculiar service,
soon fell<br>
back, and the head of Reille's Brigade began their march towards
the<br>
ch&acirc;teau. The English artillery is unmasked and opens its
fire. Kellermann<br>
advances at a gallop his twelve pieces of artillery; the
ch&acirc;teau is<br>
concealed from view by the dense smoke, and as the attack
thickens, fresh<br>
troops pour forward, the artillery thundering on either side; the
entire<br>
lines of both armies stand motionless spectators of the terrific
combat,<br>
while every eye is turned towards that devoted spot from whose
dense mass<br>
of cloud and smoke the bright glare of artillery is flashing, as
the<br>
crashing masonry, the burning rafters, and the loud yell of
battle add<br>
to the frightful interest of the scene. For above an hour the
tremendous<br>
attack continues without cessation; the artillery stationed upon
the height<br>
has now found its range, and every ringing shot tells upon the
tottering<br>
walls; some wounded soldiers return faint and bleeding from the
conflict,<br>
but there are few who escape. A crashing volley of fire-arms is
now heard<br>
from the side where the orchard stands; a second, and a third
succeed, one<br>
after the other as rapid as lightning itself. A silence follows,
when,<br>
after a few moments, a deafening cheer bursts forth, and an
aide-de-camp<br>
gallops up to say that the orchard has been carried at the point
of the<br>
bayonet, the Nassau sharp-shooters who held it having, after a
desperate<br>
resistance, retired before the irresistible onset of the French
infantry.<br>
"A moi! maintenant!" said General Foy, as he drew his sabre and
rode down<br>
to the head of his splendid division, which, anxious for the word
to<br>
advance, was standing in the valley. "En avant! mes braves!"
cried he,<br>
while, pointing to the ch&acirc;teau with his sword, he dashed
boldly forward.<br>
Scarcely had he advanced a hundred yards, when a cannon-shot,
"ricocheting"<br>
as it went, struck his horse in the counter and rolled him dead
on the<br>
plain. Disengaging himself from the lifeless animal, at once he
sprang to<br>
his feet, and hurried forward. The column was soon hid from my
view, and I<br>
was left to mourn over the seemingly inevitable fate that
impended over my<br>
gallant countrymen.</p>

<p>In the intense interest which chained me to this part of the
field, I had<br>
not noticed till this moment that the Emperor and his staff were
standing<br>
scarcely thirty yards from where I was. Napoleon, seated upon a
gray,<br>
almost white, Arabian, had suffered the reins to fall loosely on
the neck<br>
as he held with both hands his telescope to his eye; his dress,
the usual<br>
green coat with white facings, the uniform of the <i>chasseurs
&agrave; cheval</i>,<br>
was distinguished merely by the cross of the legion; his high
boots were<br>
splashed and mud-stained from riding through the deep and clayey
soil; his<br>
compact and clean-bred charger looked also slightly blown and
heated, but<br>
he himself, and I watched his features well, looked calm,
composed, and<br>
tranquil. How anxiously did I scrutinize that face; with what a
throbbing<br>
heart did I canvass every gesture, hoping to find some passing
trait of<br>
doubt, of difficulty, or of hesitation; but none was there.
Unlike one who<br>
looked upon the harrowing spectacle of the battle-field, whose
all was<br>
depending on the game before him; gambling with one throw his
last his only<br>
stake, and that the empire of the world. Yet, could I picture to
myself one<br>
who felt at peace within himself,&mdash;naught of reproach, naught of
regret to<br>
move or stir his spirit, whose tranquil barque had glided over
the calm sea<br>
of life, unruffled by the breath of passion,&mdash;I should have
fancied such<br>
was he.</p>

<p>Beside him sat one whose flashing eye and changing features
looked in every<br>
way his opposite; watching with intense anxiety the scene of the
deadly<br>
struggle round the ch&acirc;teau, every look, every gesture told
the changing<br>
fortune of the moment; his broad and brawny chest glittered with
orders and<br>
decorations, but his heavy brow and lowering look, flushed almost
black<br>
with excitement, could not easily be forgotten. It was Soult,
who, in his<br>
quality of major-general, accompanied the Emperor throughout the
day.</p>

<p>"They have lost it again, Sire," said the marshal,
passionately; "and see,<br>
they are forming beneath the cross-fire of the artillery; the
head of the<br>
column keeps not its formation two minutes together; why does he
not move<br>
up?"</p>

<p>"Domont, you know the British; what troops are those in the
orchard? They<br>
use the bayonet well."</p>

<p>The officer addressed pointed his glass for a moment to the
spot. Then,<br>
turning to the Emperor, replied, as he touched his hat, "They are
the<br>
Guards, Sire."</p>

<p>During this time Napoleon spoke not a word; his eye ever bent
upon the<br>
battle, he seemed to pay little if any attention to the
conversation about<br>
him. As he looked, an aide-de-camp, breathless and heated,
galloped up.</p>

<p>"The columns of attack are formed, Sire; everything is ready,
and the<br>
marshal only waits the order."</p>

<p>Napoleon turned upon his saddle, and directing his glass
towards Ney's<br>
Division, looked fixedly for some moments at them. His eye moved
from front<br>
to rear slowly, and at last, carrying his telescope along the
line, he<br>
fixed it steadily upon the far left. Here, towards St. Lambert, a
slight<br>
cloud seemed to rest on the horizon, as the Emperor continued to
gaze<br>
steadfastly at it. Every glass of the staff was speedily turned
in that<br>
direction.</p>

<p>"It is nothing but a cloud; some exhalation from the low
grounds in that<br>
quarter," whispered one.</p>

<p>"To me," said another, "they look like trees, part of the Bois
de Wavre."</p>

<p>"They are men," said the Emperor, speaking for the first time.
"Est-ce<br>
Grouchy? Est-ce Blucher?"</p>

<p>Soult inclines to believe it to be the former, and proceeds to
give his<br>
reasons; but the Emperor, without listening, turns towards
Domont, and<br>
orders him, with his division of light cavalry and Subervic's
Brigade, to<br>
proceed thither at once. If it be Grouchy, to establish a
junction with<br>
him; to resist, should it prove to be the advanced guard of
Marshal<br>
Blucher. Scarcely is the order given when a column of cavalry,
wheeling<br>
"fours about," unravels itself from the immense mass, and seems
to<br>
serpentine like an enormous snake between the squares of the
mighty army.<br>
The pace increases at every moment, and at length we see them
emerge from<br>
the extreme right and draw up, as if on parade, above half a mile
from the<br>
wood. This movement, by its precision and beauty, attracted our
entire<br>
attention, not only from the attack upon Hougoumont, but also
from an<br>
incident which had taken place close beside us. This was the
appearance<br>
of a Prussian hussar who had been taken prisoner between Wavre
and<br>
Planchenoit; he was the bearer of a letter from Bulow to
Wellington,<br>
announcing his arrival at St. Lambert, and asking for orders.</p>

<p>This at once explains the appearance on the right; but the
prisoner also<br>
adds, that the three Prussian corps were at Wavre, having pushed
their<br>
patrols two leagues from that town without ever encountering any
portion of<br>
the force under the command of Grouchy. For a moment not a word
is spoken.<br>
A silence like a panic pervades the staff; the Emperor himself is
the first<br>
to break it.</p>

<p>"This morning," said he, turning towards Soult, "the chances
were ninety to<br>
one in our favor; Bulow's arrival has already lost us thirty of
the number;<br>
but the odds are still sufficient, if Grouchy but repair the
<i>horrible<br>
fault</i> he has committed."</p>

<p>He paused for a moment, and as he lifted up his own hand, and
turned a look<br>
of indignant passion towards the staff, added, in a voice the
sarcasm of<br>
whose tone there is no forgetting:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Il s'amuse &agrave; Gembloux! Still," said he, speaking
rapidly and with more<br>
energy than I had hitherto noticed, "Bulow may be entirely cut
off. Let<br>
an officer approach. Take this letter, sir," giving as he spoke,
Bulow's<br>
letter to Lord Wellington,&mdash;"give this letter to Marshal Grouchy;
tell him<br>
that at this moment he should be before Wavre; tell him that
already, had<br>
he obeyed his orders&mdash;but no, tell him to march at once, to press
forward<br>
his cavalry, to come up in two hours, in three at farthest. You
have but<br>
five leagues to ride; see, sir, that you reach him within an
hour."</p>

<p>As the officer hurries away at the top of his speed, an
aide-de-camp from<br>
General Domont confirms the news; they are the Prussians whom he
has before<br>
him. As yet, however, they are debouching from the wood, and have
attempted<br>
no forward movement.</p>

<p>"What's Bulow's force, Marshal?"</p>

<p>"Thirty thousand, Sire."</p>

<p>"Let Lobau take ten thousand, with the Cuirassiers of the
Young Guard, and<br>
hold the Prussians in check."</p>

<p>"Maintenant, pour les autres," this he said with a smile, as
he turned his<br>
eyes once more towards the field of battle. The aide-de-camp of
Marshal<br>
Ney, who, bare-headed and expectant, sat waiting for orders,
presented<br>
himself to view. The Emperor turned towards him as he said, with
a clear<br>
and firm voice:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Tell the marshal to open the fire of his batteries; to carry
La Haye<br>
Sainte with the bayonet, and leaving an infantry division for
its<br>
protection, to march against La Papelotte and La Haye. They must
be carried<br>
by the bayonet."</p>

<p>The aide-de-camp was gone; Napoleon's eye followed him as he
crossed the<br>
open plain and was lost in the dense ranks of the dark columns.
Scarcely<br>
five minutes elapsed when eighty guns thundered out together, and
as the<br>
earth shook and trembled beneath, the mighty movement of the day
began its<br>
execution. From Hougoumont, where the slaughter and the carnage
continued<br>
unslackened and unstayed, every eye was now turned towards the
right. I<br>
knew not what troops occupied La Haye Sainte, or whether they
were British<br>
who crowned the heights above it; but in my heart how fervently
did I pray<br>
that they might be so. Oh, in that moment of suspense and
agonizing doubt,<br>
what would I not have given to know that Picton himself and the
fighting<br>
Fifth were there; that behind that ridge the Greys, the Royals,
and the<br>
Enniskilleners sat motionless, but burning to advance; and the
breath<br>
of battle waved among the tartans of the Highlanders, and blew
upon the<br>
flashing features of my own island countrymen. Had I known this,
I could<br>
have marked the onset with a less failing spirit.</p>

<p>"There goes Marcognet's Division," said my companion,
springing to his<br>
legs; "they're moving to the right of the road. I should like to
see the<br>
troops that will stand before them."</p>

<p>So saying, he mounted his horse, and desiring me to accompany
him, rode to<br>
the height beside La Belle Alliance. The battle was now raging
from the<br>
Ch&acirc;teau de Hougoumont to St. Lambert, where the Prussian
tirailleurs, as<br>
they issued from the wood, were skirmishing with the advanced
posts of<br>
Lobau's Brigade. The attack upon the centre, however, engrossed
all my<br>
attention, and I watched the dark columns as they descended into
the plain,<br>
while the incessant roll of the artillery played about them. To
the right<br>
of Ney's attack, D'Erlon advanced with three divisions, and the
artillery<br>
of the Guard. Towards this part of the field my companion moved.
General le<br>
Vasseur desired to know if the division on the Brussels road were
English<br>
or Hanoverian troops, and I was sent for to answer the question.
We passed<br>
from square to square until at length we found ourselves upon the
flank of<br>
D'Erlon's Division. Le Vasseur, who at the head of his
cuirassiers waited<br>
but the order to charge, waved impatiently with his sword for us
to<br>
approach. We were now to the right of the high road, and about
four hundred<br>
yards from the crest of the hill where, protected by a slight
hedge,<br>
Picton, with Kempt's Brigade, waited the attack of the enemy.</p>

<p>Just at this moment an incident took place which, while in
itself one of<br>
the most brilliant achievements of the day, changed in a signal
manner my<br>
own fortunes. The head of D'Erlon's column pressed with fixed
bayonets up<br>
the gentle slope. Already the Belgian infantry give way before
them. The<br>
brave Brunswickers, overwhelmed by the heavy cavalry of France,
at first<br>
begin to waver, then are broken; and at last retreat in disorder
up the<br>
road, a whirlwind of pursuing squadrons thundering behind them.
"En avant!<br>
en avant! la victoire est &egrave;nous," is shouted madly through
the impatient<br>
ranks; and the artillery is called up to play upon the British
squares;<br>
upon which, fixed and immovable, the cuirassiers have charged
without<br>
success. Like a thunderbolt, the flying artillery dashes to the
front;<br>
but scarcely has it reached the bottom of the ascent, when, from
the deep<br>
ground, the guns become embedded in the soil, the wheels refuse
to move. In<br>
vain the artillery drivers whip and spur their laboring cattle.
Impatiently<br>
the leading files of the column prick with their bayonets the
struggling<br>
horses. The hesitation is fatal; for Wellington, who, with eager
glance,<br>
watches from an eminence beside the high road the advancing
column, sees<br>
the accident. An order is given; and with one fell swoop, the
heavy cavalry<br>
brigade pour down. Picton's Division deploys into line; the
bayonets glance<br>
above the ridge; and with a shout that tells above the battle, on
they<br>
come, the fighting Fifth. One volley is exchanged; but the
bayonet is now<br>
brought to the charge, and the French division retreat in close
column,<br>
pursued by their gallant enemy. Scarcely have the leading
divisions fallen<br>
back, and the rear pressed down upon, or thrown into disorder,
when the<br>
cavalry trumpets sound a charge; the bright helmets of the
Enniskilleners<br>
come flashing in the sunbeams, and the Scotch Greys, like a
white-crested<br>
wave, are rolling upon the foe. Marcognet's Division is
surrounded; the<br>
dragoons ride them down on every side; the guns are captured; the
drivers<br>
cut down; and two thousand prisoners are carried off. A sudden
panic seems<br>
to seize upon the French, as cavalry, infantry, and artillery are
hurried<br>
back on each other. Vainly the French attempt to rally; the
untiring enemy<br>
press madly on; the household brigade, led on by Lord Uxbridge,
came<br>
thundering down the road, riding down with their gigantic force
the mailed<br>
cuirassiers of France. Borne along with the retreating torrents,
I was<br>
carried on amidst the densely commingled mass. The British
cavalry, which,<br>
like the lightnings that sever the thunder-cloud, pierces through
in every<br>
direction, plunged madly upon us. The roar of battle grew louder,
as hand<br>
to hand they fought. Milhaud's Heavy Dragoons, with the 4th
Lancers, came<br>
up at a gallop. Picton presses forward, waving his plumed hat
above his<br>
head; his proud eye flashes with the fire of victory. That moment
is his<br>
last. Struck in the forehead by a musket-ball, he falls dead from
the<br>
saddle; and the wild yell of the Irish regiments, as they ring
his<br>
death-cry, are the last sounds which he hears. Meanwhile the Life
Guards<br>
are among us; prisoners of rank are captured on every side; and
I, seizing<br>
the moment, throw myself among the ranks of my countrymen, and am
borne to<br>
the rear with the retiring squadrons.</p>

<p>As we reached the crest of the hill above the road, a loud
cheer in the<br>
valley beneath us burst forth, and from the midst of the dense
smoke a<br>
bright and pointed flame shot up towards the sky. It was the
farm-house La<br>
Haye Sainte, which the French had succeeded in setting fire to
with hot<br>
shot. For some time past the ammunition of the corps that held it
had<br>
failed, and a dropping irregular musketry was the only reply to
the<br>
incessant rattle of the enemy. As the smoke cleared away we
discovered that<br>
the French had carried the position; and as no quarter was given
in that<br>
deadly hand-to-hand conflict, not one returned to our ranks to
toll the<br>
tale of their defeat.</p>

<p>"This is the officer that I spoke of," said an aide-decamp, as
he rode up<br>
to where I was standing bare-headed and without a sword. "He has
just made<br>
his escape from the French lines, and will be able to give your
lordship<br>
some information."</p>

<p>The handsome features and gorgeous costume of Lord Uxbridge
were known<br>
to me; but I was not aware, till afterward, that a
soldier-like,<br>
resolute-looking officer beside him was General Graham. It was
the latter<br>
who first addressed me.</p>

<p>"Are you aware, sir," said he, "if Grouchy's force have
arrived?"</p>

<p>"They have not; on the contrary, shortly before I escaped, an
aide-de-camp<br>
was despatched to Gembloux, to hasten his coming. And the troops,
for they<br>
must be troops, were debouching from the wood yonder. They seem
to form a<br>
junction with the corps to the right; they are the Prussians.
They arrived<br>
there before noon from St. Lambert, and are part of Bulow's
Corps. Count<br>
Lobau and his division of ten thousand men were despatched, about
an hour<br>
since, to hold them in check."</p>

<p>"This is great news," said Lord Uxbridge. "Fitzroy must know
it at once."</p>

<p>So saying, he dashed spurs into his horse, and soon
disappeared amidst the<br>
crowd on the hill-top.</p>

<p>"You had better see the duke, sir," said Graham. "Your
information is too<br>
important to be delayed. Captain Calvert, let this officer have a
horse;<br>
his own is too tired to go much farther."</p>

<p>"And a cap, I beg of you," added I in an undertone, "for I
have already<br>
found a sabre."</p>

<p>By a slightly circuitous route we reached the road, upon which
a mass<br>
of dismounted artillery-carts, baggage-wagons, and tumbrils were
heaped<br>
together as a barricade against the attack of the French
dragoons, who more<br>
than once had penetrated to the very crest of our position. Close
to this<br>
and on a little rising ground, from which a view of the entire
field<br>
extended, from Hougoumont to the far left, the Duke of Wellington
stood<br>
surrounded by his staff. His eye was bent upon the valley before
him, where<br>
the advancing columns of Ney's attack still pressed onward; while
the fire<br>
of sixty great guns poured death and carnage into his lines. The
Second<br>
Belgian Division, routed and broken, had fallen back upon the
27th<br>
Regiment, who had merely time to throw themselves into square,
when<br>
Milhaud's cuirassiers, armed with their terrible long, straight
swords,<br>
came sweeping down upon them. A line of impassable bayonets, a
living<br>
<i>chevaux-de-frise</i> of the best blood of Britain, stood firm and
motionless<br>
before the shock. The French <i>mitraille</i> played mercilessly on
the ranks;<br>
but the chasms were filled up like magic, and in vain the bold
horsemen of<br>
Gaul galloped round the bristling files. At length the word,
"Fire!" was<br>
heard within the square, and as the bullets at pistol-range
rattled upon<br>
them, the cuirass afforded them no defence against the deadly
volley. Men<br>
and horses rolled indiscriminately upon the earth. Then would
come a charge<br>
of our clashing squadrons, who, riding recklessly upon the foe,
were in<br>
their turn to be repulsed by numbers, and fresh attacks poured
down upon<br>
our unshaken infantry.</p>

<p>"That column yonder is wavering. Why does he not bring up his
supporting<br>
squadrons?" inquired the duke, pointing to a Belgian regiment of
light<br>
dragoons, who were formed in the same brigade with the 7th
Hussars.</p>

<p>"He refuses to oppose his light cavalry to cuirassiers, my
lord," said an<br>
aide-de-camp, who had just returned from the division in
question.</p>

<p>"Tell him to march his men off the ground," said the duke in a
quiet and<br>
impassive tone.</p>

<p>In less than ten minutes the "Belgian regiment" was seen to
defile from the<br>
mass and take the road to Brussels, to increase the panic of that
city by<br>
circulating and strengthening the report that the English were
beaten, and<br>
Napoleon in full march upon the capital.</p>

<p>"What's Ney's force; can you guess, sir?" said the Duke of
Wellington,<br>
turning to me.</p>

<p>"About twelve thousand men, my lord."</p>

<p>"Are the Guard among them?"</p>

<p>"No, sir; the Guard are in reserve above La Belle
Alliance."</p>

<p>"In what part of the field is Bonaparte?"</p>

<p>"Nearly opposite to where we stand."</p>

<p>"I told you, gentlemen, Hougoumont never was the great attack.
The battle<br>
must be decided here," pointing as he spoke to the plain beneath
us, where<br>
Ney still poured on his devoted columns, where yet the French
cavalry rode<br>
down upon our firm squares.</p>

<p>As he spoke, an aide-de-camp rode up from the valley.</p>

<p>"The Ninety-second requires support, my lord. They cannot
maintain their<br>
position half an hour longer with out it."</p>

<p>"Have they given way, sir?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, then, they must stand where they are. I hear cannon
towards the<br>
left; yonder, near Frischermont."</p>

<p>At this moment the light cavalry swept past the base of the
hill on which<br>
we stood, hotly followed by the French heavy cuirassier brigade.
Three<br>
of our guns were taken; and the cheering of the French infantry,
as they<br>
advanced to the charge, presaged their hope of victory.</p>

<p>"Do it, then," said the duke, in reply to some whispered
question of Lord<br>
Uxbridge; and shortly after the heavy trot of advancing squadrons
was heard<br>
behind.</p>

<p>They were the Life Guards and the Blues, who, with the 1st
Dragoon Guards<br>
and the Enniskilleners, were formed into close column.</p>

<p>"I know the ground, my lord," said I to Lord Uxbridge.</p>

<p>"Come along, sir, come along," said he, as he threw his hussar
jacket<br>
loosely behind him to give freedom to his sword arm. "Forward, my
men,<br>
forward; but steady, hold your horses in hand, threes about, and
together,<br>
charge!</p>

<p>"Charge!" he shouted; while as the word flew from squadron to
squadron,<br>
each horseman bent upon his saddle, and that mighty mass, as
though<br>
instinct with but one spirit, dashed like a thunderbolt upon the
column<br>
beneath them. The French, blown and exhausted, inferior besides
in weight,<br>
both of man and horse, offered but a short resistance. As the
tall corn<br>
bends beneath the sweeping hurricane, wave succeeding wave, so
did the<br>
steel-clad squadrons of France fall before the nervous arm of
Britain's<br>
cavalry. Onward they went, carrying death and ruin before them,
and never<br>
stayed their course until the guns were recaptured, and the
cuirassiers,<br>
repulsed, disordered, and broken, had retired beneath the
protection of<br>
their artillery.</p>

<p>There was, as a brilliant and eloquent writer on the subject
mentions, a<br>
terrible sameness in the whole of this battle. Incessant charges
of cavalry<br>
upon the squares of our infantry, whose sole manoeuvre consisted
in either<br>
deploying into line to resist the attack of the infantry, or
falling back<br>
into square when the cavalry advanced; performing those two
evolutions<br>
under the devastating fire of artillery, before the unflinching
heroism of<br>
that veteran infantry whose glories have been reaped upon the
blood-stained<br>
fields of Austerlitz, Marengo, and Wagram, or opposing an
unbroken front<br>
to the whirlwind swoop of infuriated cavalry. Such were the
enduring and<br>
devoted services demanded from the English troops; and such they
failed not<br>
to render. Once or twice had temper nearly failed them, and the
cry ran<br>
through the ranks, "Are we never to move forward? Only let us at
them!" But<br>
the word was not yet spoken which was to undam the pent-up
torrent, and<br>
bear down with unrelenting vengeance upon the now exulting
columns of the<br>
enemy.</p>

<p>It was six o'clock; the battle had continued with unchanged
fortune for<br>
three hours. The French, masters of La Haye Sainte, could never
advance<br>
farther into our position. They had gained the orchard of
Hougoumont; but<br>
the ch&acirc;teau was still held by the British Guards, although
its blazing<br>
roof and crumbling walls made its occupation rather the desperate
stand of<br>
unflinching valor than the maintenance of an important position.
The smoke<br>
which hung upon the field rolled in slow and heavy masses back
upon the<br>
French lines, and gradually discovered to our view the entire of
the army.<br>
We quickly perceived that a change was taking place in their
position. The<br>
troops, which on their left stretched far beyond Hougoumont, were
now moved<br>
nearer to the centre. The attack upon the ch&acirc;teau seemed
less vigorously<br>
supported, while the oblique direction of their right wing,
which, pivoting<br>
upon Planchenoit, opposed a face to the Prussians, all denoted a
change in<br>
their order of battle. It was now the hour when Napoleon, at last
convinced<br>
that nothing but the carnage he could no longer support could
destroy the,<br>
unyielding ranks of British infantry; that although Hougoumont
had been<br>
partially, La Haye Sainte completely won; that upon the right of
the road<br>
the farm-houses Papolotte and La Haye were nearly surrounded by
his troops,<br>
which with any other army must prove the forerunner of
defeat,&mdash;yet still<br>
the victory was beyond his grasp. The bold stratagems, whose
success the<br>
experience of a life had proved, were here to be found powerless.
The<br>
decisive manoeuvre of carrying one important point of the enemy's
lines, of<br>
turning him upon the flank, or piercing him through the centre,
were here<br>
found impracticable. He might launch his avalanche of grape-shot,
he might<br>
pour down his crashing columns of cavalry, he might send forth
the iron<br>
storm of his brave infantry; but though death in every shape
heralded their<br>
approach, still were others found to fill the fallen ranks, and
feed with<br>
their hearts' blood the unslaked thirst for slaughter. Well might
the<br>
gallant leader of this gallant host, as he watched the reckless
onslaught<br>
of the untiring enemy, and looked upon the unflinching few who,
bearing the<br>
proud badge of Britain, alone sustained the fight, well might he
exclaim,<br>
"Night or Blucher!"</p>

<p>It was now seven o'clock, when a dark mass was seen to form
upon the<br>
heights above the French centre, and divide into three gigantic
columns,<br>
of which the right occupied the Brussels road. These were the
reserves,<br>
consisting of the Old and Young Guards, and amounting to
twelve<br>
thousand,&mdash;the <i>&eacute;lite</i> of the French army,&mdash;reserved by
the Emperor for<br>
a great <i>coup-de-main</i>. These veterans of a hundred battles had
been<br>
stationed from the beginning of the day, inactive spectators of
the fight;<br>
their hour was now come, and with a shout of "Vive l'Empereur!"
which rose<br>
triumphantly over the din and crash of battle, they began their
march.<br>
Meanwhile aides-de-camp galloped along the lines announcing the
arrival of<br>
Grouchy, to reanimate the drooping spirits of the men; for at
last a doubt<br>
of victory was breaking upon the minds of those who never before,
in the<br>
most adverse hour of fortune, deemed <i>his</i> star could be set that
led them<br>
on to glory.</p>

<p>"They are coming; the attack will be made on the centre, my
lord," said<br>
Lord Fitzroy Somerset, as he directed his glass upon the column.
Scarcely<br>
had he spoken when the telescope fell from his hand, as his arm,
shattered<br>
by a French bullet, fell motionless to his side.</p>

<p>"I see it," was the cool reply of the duke, as he ordered the
Guards to<br>
deploy into line and lie down behind the ridge, which now the
French<br>
artillery had found the range of, and were laboring at their
guns. In front<br>
of them the Fifty-second, Seventy-first, and Ninety-fifth were
formed; the<br>
artillery stationed above and partly upon the road, loaded with
grape, and<br>
waited but the word to open.</p>

<p>It was an awful, a dreadful moment. The Prussian cannon
thundered on our<br>
left; but so desperate was the French resistance, they made but
little<br>
progress. The dark columns of the Guard had now commenced the
ascent, and<br>
the artillery ceased their fire as the bayonets of the grenadiers
showed<br>
themselves upon the slope. Then began that tremendous cheer from
right<br>
to left of our line, which those who heard never can forget. It
was the<br>
impatient, long-restrained burst of unslaked vengeance. With the
instinct<br>
which valor teaches, they knew the hour of trial was come; and
that wild<br>
cry flew from rank to rank, echoing from the, blood-stained walls
of<br>
Hougoumont to the far-off valley of La Papelotte. "They come!
they come!"<br>
was the cry; and the shout of "Vive l'Empereur!" mingled with the
out-burst<br>
of the British line.</p>

<p>Under an overwhelming shower of grape, to which succeeded a
charge of<br>
cavalry of the Imperial Guard, the head of Ney's column fired its
volley<br>
and advanced with the bayonet. The British artillery now opened
at half<br>
range, and although the plunging fire scathed and devasted the
dark ranks<br>
of the Guard, on they came, Ney himself on foot at their head.
Twice the<br>
leading division of that gallant column turned completely round,
as the<br>
withering fire wasted and consumed them; but they were resolved
to win.</p>

<p>Already they gained the crest of the hill, and the first line
of the<br>
British were falling back before them. The artillery closes up;
the<br>
flanking fire from the guns upon the road opens upon them; the
head of<br>
their column breaks like a shell; the duke seizes the moment, and
advances<br>
on foot towards the ridge.</p>

<p>"Up, Guards, and at them!" he cried.</p>

<p>The hour of triumph and vengeance had arrived. In a moment the
Guards were<br>
on their feet; one volley was poured in; the bayonets were
brought to<br>
the charge; they closed upon the enemy; then was seen the most
dreadful<br>
struggle that the history of all war can present. Furious
with<br>
long-restrained passion, the Guards rushed upon the leading
divisions; the<br>
Seventy-first and Ninety-fifth and Twenty-sixth overlapped them
on the<br>
flanks. Their generals fell thickly on every side; Michel,
Jamier, and<br>
Mallet are killed; Friant lies wounded upon the ground; Ney, his
dress<br>
pierced and ragged with balls, shouts still to advance; but the
leading<br>
files waver; they fall back; the supporting divisions thicken;
confusion,<br>
panic succeeds. The British press down; the cavalry come
galloping up to<br>
their assistance; and at last, pell-mell, overwhelmed and beaten,
the<br>
French fell back upon the Old Guard. This was the decisive moment
of the<br>
day; the duke closed his glass, as he said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"The field is won. Order the whole line to advance."</p>

<p>On they came, four deep, and poured like a torrent from the
height.</p>

<p>"Let the Life Guards charge them," said the duke; but every
aide-de-camp on<br>
his staff was wounded, and I myself brought the order to Lord
Uxbridge.</p>

<p>Lord Uxbridge had already anticipated his orders, and bore
down with four<br>
regiments of heavy cavalry upon the French centre. The Prussian
artillery<br>
thundered upon their flank and at their rear. The British bayonet
was in<br>
their front; while a panic fear spread through their ranks, and
the cry of<br>
"Sauve qui peut!" resounded on all sides. In vain Ney, the
bravest of the<br>
brave, in vain Soult, Bertrand, Gourgaud, and Labedoy&egrave;re,
burst from the<br>
broken, disorganized mass, and called on them to stand fast. A
battalion<br>
of the Old Guard, with Cambronne at their head, alone obeyed the
summons;<br>
forming into square, they stood between the pursuers and their
prey,<br>
offering themselves a sacrifice to the tarnished honor of their
arms. To<br>
the order to surrender they answered with a cry of defiance; and
as our<br>
cavalry, flushed and elated with victory, rode round their
bristling<br>
ranks, no quailing look, no craven spirit was there. The Emperor
himself<br>
endeavored to repair the disaster; he rode with lightning speed
hither and<br>
thither, commanding, ordering, nay, imploring, too; but already
the night<br>
was falling, the confusion became each moment more inextricable,
and the<br>
effort was a fruitless one. A regiment of the Guards, and two
batteries<br>
were in reserve behind Planchenoit. He threw them rapidly into
position;<br>
but the overwhelming impulse of flight drove the mass upon them,
and they<br>
were carried away upon the torrent of the beaten army. No sooner
did the<br>
Emperor see this his last hope desert him, than he dismounted
from his<br>
horse, and drawing his sword, threw himself into a square, which
the first<br>
regiment of Chasseurs of the Old Guard had formed with a remnant
of the<br>
battalion. Jerome followed him, as he called out,&mdash;</p>

<p>"You are right, brother; here should perish all who bear the
name of<br>
Bonaparte."</p>

<p>The same moment the Prussian light artillery rend the ranks
asunder, and<br>
the cavalry charge down upon the scattered fragments. A few of
his staff,<br>
who never left him, place the Emperor upon a horse and fly
through the<br>
death-dealing artillery and musketry. A squadron of the Life
Guards, to<br>
which I had attached myself, came up at the moment, and as
Blucher's<br>
hussars rode madly here and there, where so lately the crowd of
staff<br>
officers had denoted the presence of Napoleon, expressed their
rage and<br>
disappointment in curses and cries of vengeance.</p>

<p>Cambronne's battalion stood yet unbroken, and seemed to defy
every attack<br>
that was brought against them. To the second summons to surrender
they<br>
replied as indignantly as at first; and Vivian's Brigade was
ordered to<br>
charge them. A cloud of British horse bore down on every face of
the<br>
devoted square; but firm as in their hour of victory, the heroes
of Marengo<br>
never quailed; and twice the bravest blood of Britian recoiled,
baffled and<br>
dismayed. There was a pause for some minutes, and even then, as
we surveyed<br>
our broken and blood-stained squadrons, a cry of admiration burst
from our<br>
ranks at the gallant bearing of that glorious infantry. Suddenly
the tramp<br>
of approaching cavalry was heard; I turned my head and saw two
squadrons of<br>
the Second Life Guards. The officer who led them on was
bare-headed; his<br>
long dark hair streaming wildly behind him, and upon his pale
features,<br>
to which not even the headlong enthusiasm of battle had lent one
touch of<br>
color. He rode straight to where I was standing, his dark eyes
fixed upon<br>
me with a look so fierce, so penetrating, that I could not look
away.<br>
The features, save in this respect, had almost a look of idiocy.
It was<br>
Hammersley.</p>

<p>"Ha!" he cried at last, "I have sought you out the entire day,
but in vain.<br>
It is not yet too late. Give me your hand, boy. You once called
on me to<br>
follow <i>you</i>, and I did not refuse; I trust you'll do the like by
<i>me</i>. Is<br>
it not so?"</p>

<p>[DEATH OF HAMMERSLEY.]</p>
<br><br>
<p>A terrible perception of his meaning shot through my mind as I
clasped his<br>
clay-cold hand in mine, and for a moment I did not speak.</p>

<p>"I hoped for better than this," said he, bitterly, and as a
glance of<br>
withering scorn flashed from his eye. "I did trust that he who
was<br>
preferred before me was at least not a coward."</p>

<p>As the word fell from his lips I nearly leaped from my saddle,
and<br>
mechanically raised my sabre to cleave him on the spot.</p>

<p>"Then follow me!" shouted he, pointing with his sword to the
glistening<br>
ranks before us.</p>

<p>"Come on!" said I, with a voice hoarse with passion, while
burying my spurs<br>
in my horse's flanks, I sprang on a full length before him, and
bore down<br>
upon the enemy. A loud shout, a deafening volley, the agonizing
cry of the<br>
wounded and the dying, were all I heard, as my horse, rearing
madly upward,<br>
plunged twice into the air, and then fell dead upon the earth,
crushing me<br>
beneath his cumbrous weight, lifeless and insensible.</p>

<p>The day was breaking; the cold, gray light of morning was
struggling<br>
through the misty darkness, when I once more recovered my
consciousness.<br>
There are moments in life when memory can so suddenly conjure up
the whole<br>
past before us, that there is scarcely time for a doubt ere the
disputed<br>
reality is palpable to our senses. Such was this to me. One
hurried glance<br>
upon the wide, bleak plain before me, and every circumstance of
the<br>
battle-field was present to my recollection. The dismounted guns,
the<br>
broken wagons, the heaps of dead or dying, the straggling parties
who on<br>
foot or horseback traversed the field, and the dark litters which
carried<br>
the wounded, all betokened the sad evidences of the preceding
day's battle.</p>

<p>Close around me where I lay the ground was marked with the
bodies of our<br>
cavalry, intermixed with the soldiers of the Old Guard. The broad
brow and<br>
stalwart chest of the Saxon lay bleaching beside the bronzed and
bearded<br>
warrior of Gaul, while the torn-up ground attested the
desperation of that<br>
struggle which closed the day.</p>

<p>As my eye ranged over this harrowing spectacle, a dreadful
anxiety shot<br>
through me as I asked myself whose had been the victory. A
certain confused<br>
impression of flight and of pursuit remained in my mind; but at
the moment,<br>
the circumstances of my own position in the early part of the day
increased<br>
the difficulty of reflection, and left me in a state of intense
and<br>
agonizing uncertainty. Although not wounded, I had been so
crushed by my<br>
fall that it was not without pain I got upon my legs. I soon
perceived<br>
that the spot around me had not yet been visited by those
vultures of the<br>
battle-field who strip alike the dead and dying. The distance of
the place<br>
from where the great conflict of the battle had occurred was
probably the<br>
reason; and now, as the straggling sunbeams fell upon the earth,
I could<br>
trace the helmet of the Enniskilleners, or the tall bearskin of
the Scotch<br>
Greys, lying in thick confusion where the steel cuirass and long
sword of<br>
the French dragoons showed the fight had been hottest. As I
turned my eyes<br>
hither and thither I could see no living thing near me. In every
attitude<br>
of struggling agony they lay around; some buried beneath their
horses, some<br>
bathed in blood, some, with clinched hands and darting eyeballs,
seemed<br>
struggling even in death; but all was still,&mdash;not a word, not a
sigh, not a<br>
groan was there. I was turning to leave the spot, and uncertain
which way<br>
to direct my steps, looked once more around, when my glance
rested upon<br>
the pale and marble features of one who, even in that moment of
doubt and<br>
difficulty, there was no mistaking. His coat, torn widely open,
was grasped<br>
in either hand, while his breast was shattered with balls and
bathed in<br>
gore. Gashed and mutilated as he lay, still the features wore no
trace of<br>
suffering; cold, pale, motionless, but with the tranquil look of
sleep, his<br>
eyelids were closed, and his half-parted lips seemed still to
quiver in<br>
life. I knelt down beside him; I took his hand in mine; I bent
over and<br>
whispered his name; I placed my hand upon his heart, where even
still the<br>
life blood was warm,&mdash;but he was dead. Poor Hammersley! His was a
gallant<br>
soul; and as I looked upon his blood-stained corpse, my tears
fell fast and<br>
hot upon his brow to think how far I had myself been the cause of
a life<br>
blighted in its hope, and a death like his.</p>

<br><br><br><br><p>CHAPTER LIV.</p>

<p>BRUSSELS.</p>

<p>Once more I would entreat my reader's indulgence for the
prolixity of<br>
a narrative which has grown beneath my hands to a length I had
never<br>
intended. This shall, however, be the last time for either the
offence or<br>
the apology. My story is now soon concluded.</p>

<p>After wandering about for some time, uncertain which way to
take, I at<br>
length reached the Charleroi road, now blocked by carriages and
wagons<br>
conveying the wounded towards Brussels. Here I learned, for the
first time,<br>
that we had gained the battle, and heard of the total
annihilation of the<br>
French army, and the downfall of the Emperor. On arriving at the
farm-house<br>
of Mont St. Jean, I found a number of officers, whose wounds
prevented<br>
their accompanying the army in its forward movement. One of them,
with whom<br>
I was slightly acquainted, informed me that General Dashwood had
spent<br>
the greater part of the night upon the field in search of me and
that my<br>
servant Mike was in a state of distraction at my absence that
bordered on<br>
insanity. While he was speaking, a burst of laughter and the
tones of a<br>
well-remembered voice behind attracted my attention.</p>

<p>"Made a very good thing of it, upon my life. A
dressing-case,&mdash;not gold,<br>
you know, but silver-gilt,&mdash;a dozen knives with blood-stone
handles, and a<br>
little coffee-pot, with the imperial arms,&mdash;not to speak of three
hundred<br>
Naps in a green silk purse&mdash;Lord! it reminds me of the Peninsula.
Do you<br>
know those Prussians are mere barbarians, haven't a notion of
civilized<br>
war. Bless your heart, my fellows in the Legion would have
ransacked the<br>
whole coach, from the boot to the sword-case, in half the time
they took to<br>
cut down the coachman."</p>

<p>"The major, as I live!" said I. "How goes it, Major?"</p>

<p>"Eh, Charley! when did you turn up? Delighted see you. They
told me you<br>
were badly wounded or killed or something of that kind. But I
should have<br>
paid the little debt to your executors all the same."</p>

<p>"All the same, no doubt, Major; but where, in Heaven's name,
did you fall<br>
upon that mine of pillage you have just been talking of?"</p>

<p>"In the Emperor's carriage, to be sure, boy. While the duke
was watching<br>
all day the advance of Ney's column and keeping an anxious
look-out for the<br>
Prussians, I sat in a window in this old farm-house, and never
took my eye<br>
off the garden at Planchenoit. I saw the imperial carriage there
in the<br>
morning; it was there also at noon; and they never put the horses
to it<br>
till past seven in the evening. The roads were very heavy, and
the crowd<br>
was great. I judged the pace couldn't be a fast one; and with
four of the<br>
Enniskilleners I charged it like a man. The Prussians, however,
had the<br>
start of us; and if they hadn't thought, from my seat on
horseback and<br>
my general appearance, that I was Lord Uxbridge, I should have
got but a<br>
younger son's portion. However, I got in first, filled my pockets
with a<br>
few little <i>souvenirs</i> of the Emperor, and then laying my hands
upon what<br>
was readiest, got out in time to escape being shot; for two of
Blucher's<br>
hussars, thinking I must be the Emperor, fired at me through the
window."</p>

<p>"What an escape you had!"</p>

<p>"Hadn't I though? Fortunate, too, my Enniskilleners saw the
whole thing;<br>
for I intend to make the circumstance the ground of an
application for a<br>
pension. Hark ye, Charley, don't say anything about the
coffee-pot and<br>
the knives. The duke, you know, has strange notions of his own on
these<br>
matters. But isn't that your fellow fighting his way yonder?"</p>

<p>"Tear and ages! don't howld me&mdash;that's himself,&mdash;devil a one
else!"</p>

<p>This exclamation came from Mickey Free, who, with his dress
torn and<br>
dishevelled, his eyes bloodshot and strained, was upsetting and
elbowing<br>
all before him, as he made his way towards me through the
crowd.</p>

<p>"Take that fellow to the guard-house! Lay hold of him,
Sergeant! Knock him<br>
down! Who is the scoundrel?"</p>

<p>Such were the greetings he met with on every side. Regardless
of everything<br>
and everybody, he burst his way through the dense mass.</p>

<p>"Oh, murther! oh, Mary! oh, Moses! Is he safe here after
all?"</p>

<p>The poor fellow could say no more, but burst into a torrent of
tears.<br>
A roar of laughter around him soon, however, turned the current
of his<br>
emotions; when, dashing the scalding drops from his eyelids, he
glared<br>
fiercely like a tiger on every side.</p>

<p>"Ye're laughing at me, are ye," cried he, "bekase I love the
hand that fed<br>
me, and the master that stood to me? But let us see now which of
us two has<br>
the stoutest heart,&mdash;you with your grin on you, or myself with
the salt<br>
tears on my face."</p>

<p>As he spoke, he sprang upon them like a madman, striking right
and left at<br>
everything before him. Down they went beneath his blows, levelled
with the<br>
united strength of energy and passion, till at length, rushing
upon him<br>
in numbers, he was overpowered and thrown to the ground. It was
with some<br>
difficulty I accomplished his rescue; for his enemies felt by no
means<br>
assured how far his amicable propensities for the future could be
relied<br>
upon; and, indeed, Mike himself had a most constitutional
antipathy to<br>
binding himself by any pledge. With some persuasion, however, I
reconciled<br>
all parties; and having, by the kindness of a brother officer,
provided<br>
myself with a couple of troop horses, I mounted, and set out for
Brussels,<br>
followed by Mickey, who had effectually cured his auditory of any
tendency<br>
to laughter at his cost.</p>

<p>As I rode up to the Belle Vue, I saw Sir George Dashwood in
the window. He<br>
was speaking to the ambassador, Lord Clancarty, but the moment he
caught my<br>
eye, he hurried down to meet me.</p>

<p>"Charley, safe,&mdash;safe, my boy! Now am I really happy. The
glorious day had<br>
been one of sorrow to me for the rest of my life had anything
happened to<br>
you. Come up with me at once; I have more than one friend here
who longs to<br>
thank you."</p>

<p>So saying, he hurried me along; and before I could well
remember where I<br>
was, introduced me to a number of persons in the saloon.</p>

<p>"Ah, very happy to know you, sir," said Lord Clancarty.
"Perhaps we had<br>
better walk this way. My friend Dashwood has explained to me the
very<br>
pressing reasons there are for this step; and I, for my part, see
no<br>
objection."</p>

<p>"What, in Heaven's name, can he mean?" thought I, as he
stopped short,<br>
expecting me to say something, while, in utter confusion, I
smiled,<br>
simpered, and muttered some common-places.</p>

<p>"Love and war, sir," resumed the ambassador, "very admirable
associates,<br>
and you certainly have contrived to couple them most closely
together. A<br>
long attachment, I believe?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, a very long attachment," stammered I, not knowing
which of us<br>
was about to become insane.</p>

<p>"A very charming person, indeed; I have seen the lady,"
replied his<br>
lordship, as he opened the door of a small room, and beckoned me
to follow.<br>
The table was covered with paper and materials for writing; but
before<br>
I had time to ask for any explanation of this unaccountable
mystery, he<br>
added, "Oh, I was forgetting; this must be witnessed. Wait one
moment."</p>

<p>With these words he left the room, while I, amazed and
thunderstruck,<br>
vacillating between fear and hope, trembling lest the delusive
glimmering<br>
of happiness should give way at every moment, and yet totally
unable to<br>
explain by any possible supposition how fortune could so far have
favored<br>
me.</p>

<p>While yet I stood hesitating and uncertain, the door opened,
and the<br>
senhora entered. She looked a little pale though not less
beautiful than<br>
ever; and her features wore a slight trace of seriousness, which
rather<br>
heightened than took from the character of her loveliness.</p>

<p>"I heard you had come, Chevalier," said she, "and so I ran
down to shake<br>
hands with you. We may not meet again for some time."</p>

<p>"How so, Senhora? You are not going to leave us, I trust?"</p>

<p>"Then you have not seen Fred. Oh, I forgot; you know nothing
of our plans."</p>

<p>"Here we are at last," said the ambassador, as he came in
followed by Sir<br>
George, Power, and two other officers. "Ah, <i>ma belle</i>, how
fortunate to<br>
find you here! I assure you, it is a matter of no small
difficulty to get<br>
people together at such a time as this."</p>

<p>"Charley, my dear friend," cried Power, "I scarcely hoped to
have had a<br>
shake hands with you ere I left."</p>

<p>"Do, Fred, tell me what all this means? I am in a perfect maze
of doubt and<br>
difficulty, and cannot comprehend a word I hear about me."</p>

<p>"Faith, my boy, I have little time for explanation. The man
who was at<br>
Waterloo yesterday, is to be married to-morrow, and to sail for
India in a<br>
week, has quite enough upon his hands."</p>

<p>"Colonel Power, you will please to put your signature here,"
said Lord<br>
Clancarty, addressing himself to me.</p>

<p>"If you will allow me," said Fred, "I had rather represent
myself."</p>

<p>"Is not this the colonel, then? Why, confound it, I have been
wishing him<br>
joy the last quarter of an hour!"</p>

<p>A burst of laughter from the whole party, in which it was
pretty evident I<br>
took no part, followed this announcement.</p>

<p>"And so you are not Colonel Power? Nor going to be married,
either?"</p>

<p>I stammered out something, while, overwhelmed with confusion,
I stooped<br>
down to sign the paper. Scarcely had I done so, when a renewed
burst of<br>
laughter broke from the party.</p>

<p>"Nothing but blunders, upon my soul," said the ambassador, as
he handed the<br>
paper from one to another.</p>

<p>What was my confusion to discover that instead of Charles
O'Malley, I had<br>
written the name of Lucy Dashwood. I could bear no more. The
laughing and<br>
raillery of my friends came upon my wounded and irritated
feelings like the<br>
most poignant sarcasm. I seized my cap and rushed from the room.
Desirous<br>
of escaping from all that knew me, anxious to bury my agitated
and<br>
distracted thoughts in solitude and quiet, I opened the first
door before<br>
me, and seeing it an empty and unoccupied room, throw myself upon
a sofa,<br>
and buried my head within my hands. Oh, how often had the phantom
of<br>
happiness passed within my reach, but still glided from my grasp!
How often<br>
had I beheld the goal I aimed at, as it were before me, and the
next moment<br>
all the bleak reality of my evil fortune was lowering around
me!</p>

<p>"Oh, Lucy, Lucy!" I exclaimed aloud, "but for you and a few
words<br>
carelessly spoken, I had never trod that path of ambition whose
end has<br>
been the wreck of all my happiness. But for you, I had never
loved so<br>
fondly; I had never filled my mind with one image which,
excluding every<br>
other thought, leaves no pleasure but in it alone. Yes, Lucy, but
for you I<br>
should have gone tranquilly down the stream of life with naught
of grief or<br>
care, save such as are inseparable from the passing chances of
mortality;<br>
loved, perhaps, and cared for by some one who would have deemed
it no<br>
disgrace to have linked her fortune to my own. But for you, and I
had never<br>
been&mdash;"</p>

<p>"A soldier, you would say," whispered a soft voice, as a light
hand gently<br>
touched my shoulder. "I had come," continued she, "to thank you
for a gift<br>
no gratitude can repay,&mdash;my father's life; but truly, I did not
think to<br>
hear the words you have spoken; nor having heard them, can I feel
their<br>
justice. No, Mr. O'Malley, deeply grateful as I am to you for the
service<br>
you once rendered myself, bound as I am by every tie of
thankfulness, by<br>
the greater one to my father, yet do I feel that in the impulse I
had given<br>
to your life, if so be that to me you owe it, I have done more to
repay<br>
my debt to you, than by all the friendship, all the esteem I owe
you; if,<br>
indeed, by my means, you became a soldier, if my few and random
words<br>
raised within your breast that fire of ambition which has been
your<br>
beacon-light to honor and to glory, then am I indeed proud."</p>

<p>"Alas, alas, Lucy!&mdash;Miss Dashwood, I would say,&mdash;forgive me,
if I know not<br>
the very words I utter. How has my career fulfilled the promise
that gave<br>
it birth? For you, and you only, to gain your affection, to win
your heart,<br>
I became a soldier; hardship, danger, even death itself were
courted by me,<br>
supported by the one thought that you had cared for or had pitied
me; and<br>
now, and now&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And now," said she, while her eyes beamed upon me with a very
flood of<br>
tenderness, "is it nothing that in my woman's heart I have glowed
with<br>
pride at triumphs I could read of, but dared not share in? Is it
nothing<br>
that you have lent to my hours of solitude and of musing the
fervor of that<br>
career, the maddening enthusiasm of that glorious path my sex
denied me?<br>
I have followed you in my thoughts across the burning plains of
the<br>
Peninsula, through the long hours of the march in the dreary
nights, even<br>
to the battle-field. I have thought of you; I have dreamed of
you; I have<br>
prayed for you."</p>

<p>"Alas, Lucy, but not loved me!"</p>

<p>The very words, as I spoke them, sank with a despairing
cadence upon my<br>
heart. Her hand, which had fallen upon mine, trembled violently;
I pressed<br>
my lips upon it, but she moved it not. I dared to look up; her
head was<br>
turned away, but her heaving bosom betrayed her emotion.</p>

<p>"No, no, Lucy," cried I, passionately, "I will not deceive
myself; I ask<br>
for more than you can give me. Farewell!"</p>

<p>Now, and for the last time, I pressed her hand once more to my
lips; my hot<br>
tears fell fast upon it. I turned to go, and threw one last look
upon her.<br>
Our eyes met; I cannot say what it was, but in a moment the whole
current<br>
of my thoughts was changed; her look was bent upon me beaming
with softness<br>
and affection, her hand gently pressed my own, and her lips
murmured my<br>
name.</p>

<p>The door burst open at this moment, and Sir George Dashwood
appeared. Lucy<br>
turned one fleeting look upon her father, and fell fainting into
my arms.</p>

<p>"God bless you, my boy!" said the old general, as he hurriedly
wiped a tear<br>
from his eye; "I am now, indeed, a happy father."</p>

<p>[THE WELCOME HOME.]</p>

<br><br><br><br><p>CHAPTER LV.</p>

<p>CONCLUSION.</p>

<p>       *       *       *       *       *</p>

<p>The sun had set about half an hour. Already were the dusky
shadows blending<br>
with the faint twilight, as on a lovely July evening we entered
the little<br>
village of Portumna,&mdash;we, I say; for Lucy was beside me. For the
last few<br>
miles of the way I had spoken little; thoughts of the many times
I had<br>
travelled that same road, in how many moods, occupied my mind;
and<br>
although, as we flew rapidly along, some well-known face would
every now<br>
and then present itself, I had but time for the recognition ere
we were<br>
past. Arousing myself from my revery, I was pointing out to Lucy
certain<br>
well-known spots in the landscape, and directing her attention to
places<br>
with the names of which she had been for some time familiar, when
suddenly<br>
a loud shout rent the air, and the next moment the carriage was
surrounded<br>
by hundreds of country people, some of whom brandished blazing
pine<br>
torches; others carried rude banners in their hands,&mdash;but all
testified<br>
the most fervent joy as they bade us welcome. The horses were
speedily<br>
unharnessed, and their places occupied by a crowd of every age
and sex,<br>
who hurried us along through the straggling street of the
village, now a<br>
perfect blaze of bonfires.</p>

<p>Mounds of turf, bog-fir, and tar-barrels sent up their ruddy
blaze, while<br>
hundreds of wild, but happy faces, flitted around and through
them,&mdash;now<br>
dancing merrily in chorus; now plunging madly into the midst of
the fire,<br>
and scattering the red embers on every side. Pipers were there
too, mounted<br>
upon cars or turf-kishes; even the very roof-tops rang out their
merry<br>
notes; the ensigns of the little fishing-craft waved in the
breeze, and<br>
seemed to feel the general joy around them; while over the door
of the<br>
village inn stood a brilliantly lighted transparency,
representing the head<br>
of the O'Malleys holding a very scantily-robed young lady by the
tips of<br>
the fingers; but whether this damsel was intended to represent
the genius<br>
of the west, or my wife, I did not venture to inquire.</p>

<p>If the welcome were rude, assuredly it was a hearty one. Kind
wishes and<br>
blessings poured in on every side, and even our own happiness
took a<br>
brighter coloring from the beaming looks around us. The scene was
wild;<br>
the lurid glare of the red torchlight, the frantic gestures, the
maddening<br>
shouts, the forked flames rising amidst the dark shadows of the
little<br>
hamlet, had something strange and almost unearthly in their
effect; but<br>
Lucy showed no touch of fear. It is true she grasped my hand a
little<br>
closer, but her fair cheek glowed with pleasure, and her eye
brightened as<br>
she looked; and as the rich light fell upon her beauteous
features, how<br>
many a blessing, heart-felt and deep, how many a word of fervent
praise was<br>
spoken.</p>

<p>"Ah, then, the Lord be good to you; it's yourself has the
darling blue<br>
eyes! Look at them, Mary; ain't they like the blossoms on a
peacock's tail?<br>
Musha, may sorrow never put a crease in that beautiful cheek! The
saints<br>
watch over you, for your mouth is like a moss-rose! Be good to
her, yer<br>
honor, for she's a raal gem: devil fear you, Mr. Charles, but
you'd have a<br>
beauty!"</p>

<p>We wended our way slowly, the crowd ever thickening around us,
until we<br>
reached the market-place. Here the procession came to a stand,
and I could<br>
perceive, by certain efforts around me, that some endeavor was
making to<br>
enforce silence.</p>

<p>"Whisht, there! Hould your prate! Be still, Paddy! Tear an'
ages, Molly<br>
Blake, don't be holding me that way; let us hear his reverence.
Put him up<br>
on the barrel. Haven't you got a chair for the priest? Run, and
bring a<br>
table out of Mat Haley's. Here, Father&mdash;here, your reverence;
take care,<br>
will you,&mdash;you'll have the holy man in the blaze!"</p>

<p>By this time I could perceive that my worthy old friend Father
Rush was in<br>
the midst of the mob with what appeared to be a written oration,
as long as<br>
the tail of a kite, between his hands.</p>

<p>"Be aisy, there, ye savages! Who's tearing the back of my
neck? Howld me up<br>
straight! Steady, now&mdash;hem!"</p>

<p>"Take the laste taste in life to wet your lips, your
riverence," said a<br>
kind voice, while at the same moment a smoking tumbler of what
seemed to be<br>
punch appeared on the heads of the crowd.</p>

<p>"Thank ye, Judy," said the father, as he drained the cup.
"Howld the light<br>
up higher; I can't read my speech. There now, be quiet, will ye!
Here goes.<br>
Peter, stand to me now and give me the word."</p>

<p>This admonition was addressed to a figure on a barrel behind
the priest,<br>
who, as well as the imperfect light would permit me to descry,
was the<br>
coadjutor of the parish, Peter Nolan. Silence being perfectly
established,<br>
Father Rush began:&mdash;</p>

<p>    "When Mars, the god of war, on high,<br>
    Of battles first did think,<br>
    He girt his sword upon his thigh,<br>
    And&mdash;</p>

<p>and&mdash;what is't, Peter?"</p>

<p>    "And mixed a drop of drink."</p>

<p>"And mixed a drop of drink," quoth Father Rush, with great
emphasis; when<br>
scarcely were the spoken words than a loud shout of laughter
showed him his<br>
mistake, and he overturned upon the luckless curate the full vial
of his<br>
wrath.</p>

<p>"What is it you mean, Father Peter? I'm ashamed of ye; faith,
it's may be<br>
yourself, not Mars, you are speaking of."</p>

<p>The roar of merriment around prevented me hearing what passed;
but I could<br>
see by Peter's gestures&mdash;for it was too dark to see his
face&mdash;that he was<br>
expressing deep sorrow for the mistake. After a little time,
order was<br>
again established, and Father Rush resumed:&mdash;</p>

<p>    "But love drove battles from his head,<br>
    And sick of wounds and scars,<br>
    To Venus bright he knelt, and said&mdash;</p>

<p>and said&mdash;and said; what the blazes did he say?"</p>

<p>    "I'll make you Mrs. Mars,"</p>

<p>shouted Peter, loud enough to be heard.</p>

<p>"Bad luck to you, Peter Nolan, it's yourself's the ruin of me
this blessed<br>
night! Here have I come four miles with my speech in my pocket,
<i>per imbres<br>
et ignes</i>." Here the crowd crossed themselves devoutly. "Ay, just
so; and<br>
he spoiled it for me entirely." At the earnest entreaty, however,
of the<br>
crowd, Father Rush, with renewed caution to his unhappy prompter,
again<br>
returned to the charge:</p>

<p>    "Thus love compelled the god to yield<br>
    And seek for purer joys;<br>
    He laid aside his helm and shield,<br>
    And took&mdash;</p>

<p>took&mdash;took&mdash;"</p>

<p>    "And took to corduroys,"</p>

<p>cried Father Nolan.</p>

<p>This time, however, the good priest's patience could endure no
more, and he<br>
levelled a blow at his luckless colleague, which, missing his
aim, lost him<br>
his own balance, and brought him down from his eminence upon the
heads of<br>
the mob.</p>

<p>Scarcely had I recovered the perfect convulsion of laughter
into which this<br>
scene had thrown me, when the broad brim of Father Nolan's hat
appeared at<br>
the window of the carriage. Before I had time to address him, he
took it<br>
reverently from his head, disclosing in the act the
ever-memorable features<br>
of Master Frank Webber!</p>

<p>"What! Eh! Can it be?" said I.</p>

<p>"It is surely not&mdash;" said Lucy, hesitating at the name.</p>

<p>"Your aunt, Miss Judy Macan, no more than the Rev. Peter
Nolan, I assure<br>
you; though, I confess, it has cost me much more to personate the
latter<br>
character than the former, and the reward by no means so
tempting."</p>

<p>Here poor Lucy blushed deeply at the remembrance of the scene
alluded to;<br>
and anxious to turn the conversation, I asked by what stratagem
he had<br>
succeeded to the functions of the worthy Peter.</p>

<p>"At the cost of twelve tumblers of the strongest punch ever
brewed at the<br>
O'Malley Arms. The good father gave in only ten minutes before
the oration<br>
began, and I had barely time to change my dress and mount the
barrel,<br>
without a moment's preparation."</p>

<p>The procession once more resumed its march; and hurried along
through the<br>
town, we soon reached the avenue. Here fresh preparations for
welcoming us<br>
had also been made; but regardless of blazing tar-barrels and
burning logs,<br>
the reckless crowd pressed madly on, their wild cheers waking the
echoes as<br>
they went. We soon reached the house; but with a courtesy which
even<br>
the humblest and poorest native of this country is never devoid
of, the<br>
preparations of noise and festivity had not extended to the
precincts of<br>
the dwelling. With a tact which those of higher birth and older
blood might<br>
be proud of, they limited the excesses of their reckless and
careless<br>
merriment to their own village; so that as we approached the
terrace, all<br>
was peaceful, still, and quiet.</p>

<p>I lifted Lucy from the carriage, and passing my arm around
her, was<br>
assisting her to mount the steps, when a bright gleam of
moonlight burst<br>
forth and lit up the whole scene. It was, indeed, an impressive
one. Among<br>
the assembled hundreds there who stood bare-headed, beneath the
cold<br>
moonlight, not a word was now spoken, not a whisper heard. I
turned from<br>
the lawn, where the tall beech-trees were throwing their gigantic
shadows,<br>
to where the river, peering at intervals through the foliage, was
flowing<br>
on its silvery track, plashing amidst the tall flaggers that
lined its<br>
banks,&mdash;all were familiar, all were dear to me from childhood.
How doubly<br>
were they so now! I lifted up my eyes towards the door, and what
was my<br>
surprise at the object before them! Seated in a large chair was
an old man,<br>
whose white hair, flowing in straggling masses upon his neck and
shoulders,<br>
stirred with the night air; his hands rested upon his knees, and
his eyes,<br>
turned slightly upward, seemed to seek for some one he found it
difficult<br>
to recognize. Changed as he was by time, heavily as years had
done their<br>
work upon him, the stern features were not to be mistaken; but as
I looked,<br>
he called out in a voice whose unshaken firmness seemed to defy
the touch<br>
of time,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Charley O'Malley, come here, my boy! Bring her to me, till I
bless you<br>
both. Come here, Lucy,&mdash;I may call you so. Come here, my
children. I have<br>
tried to live on to see this day, when the head of an old house
comes back<br>
with honor, with fame, and with fortune, to dwell amidst his own
people in<br>
the old home of his fathers."</p>

<p>The old man bent above us, his white hair falling upon the
fair locks of<br>
her who knelt beside him, and pressed his cold and quivering hand
within<br>
her own.</p>

<p>"Yes, Lucy," said I, as I led her within the house, "this is
home."</p>

<p>Here now ends my story. The patient reader who has followed me
so far<br>
deserves at my hands that I should not trespass upon his kindness
one<br>
moment beyond the necessity; if, however, any lurking interest
may remain<br>
for some of those who have accompanied me through this my
history, it<br>
may be as well that I should say a few words farther, ere they
disappear<br>
forever.</p>

<p>Power went to India immediately after his marriage,
distinguished himself<br>
repeatedly in the Burmese war, and finally rose to a high command
that he<br>
this moment holds, with honor to himself and advantage to his
country.</p>

<p>O'Shaughnessy, on half-pay, wanders about the Continent,
passing his<br>
summers on the Rhine, his winters at Florence or Geneva. Known to
and by<br>
everybody, his interest in the service keeps him <i>au courant</i> to
every<br>
change and regulation, rendering him an invaluable companion to
all to whom<br>
an army list is inaccessible. He is the same good fellow he ever
was, and<br>
adds to his many excellent qualities the additional one of being
the only<br>
man who can make a bull in French!</p>

<p>Monsoon, the major, when last I saw him, was standing on the
pier at<br>
Calais, endeavoring, with a cheap telescope, to make out the
Dover cliffs,<br>
from a nearer prospect of which certain little family
circumstances might<br>
possibly debar him. He recognized me in a moment, and held out
his hand,<br>
while his eye twinkled with its ancient drollery.</p>

<p>"Charley, my son, how goes it? Delighted to see you. What a
pity I did not<br>
meet you yesterday! Had a little dinner at Crillon's. Harding,
Vivian, and<br>
a few others. They all wished for you; 'pon my life they
did."</p>

<p>"Civil, certainly," thought I, "as I have not the honor of
being known to<br>
them."</p>

<p>"You are at Meurice's," resumed he; "a very good house, but
give you bad<br>
wine, if they don't know you. They know me," added he, in a
whisper; "never<br>
try any tricks upon me. I'll just drop in upon you at six."</p>

<p>"It is most unfortunate, Major; I can't have the pleasure you
speak of; we<br>
start in half an hour."</p>

<p>"Never mind, Charley, never mind; another time. By-the-bye,
now I think of<br>
it, don't you remember something of a ten-pound note you owe
me?"</p>

<p>"As well as I remember, Major, the circumstance was reversed.
You are the<br>
debtor."</p>

<p>"Upon my life, you are right; how droll. No matter; let me
have the ten,<br>
and I'll give you a check for the whole."</p>

<p>The major thrust his tongue into his cheek as he spoke, gave
another leer,<br>
pocketed the note, and sauntered down the pier, muttering
something to<br>
himself about King David and greenhorns; but how they were
connected I<br>
could not precisely overhear.</p>

<p>Baby Blake, or Mrs. Sparks,&mdash;to call her by her more
fitting<br>
appellation,&mdash;is as handsome as ever, and not less good-humored
and<br>
light-hearted, her severest trials being her ineffectual efforts
to convert<br>
Sparks into something like a man for Galway.</p>

<p>Last of all, Mickey Free. Mike remains attached to our fortune
firmly, as<br>
at first he opened his career; the same gay, rollicksome
Irishman, making<br>
songs, making love, and occasionally making punch, he spends his
days and<br>
his nights pretty much as he was wont to do some thirty years
ago. He<br>
obtains an occasional leave of absence for a week or so, but for
what<br>
precise purpose, or with what exact object, I have never been
completely<br>
able to ascertain. I have heard, it as true, that a very
fascinating<br>
companion and a most agreeable gentleman frequents a certain
oyster-house<br>
in Dublin called Burton Bindon's. I have also been told of a
distinguished<br>
foreigner, whose black mustache and broken English were the
admiration of<br>
Cheltenham for the last two winters. I greatly fear from the high
tone of<br>
the conversation in the former, and for the taste in continental
characters<br>
in the latter resort, that I could fix upon the individual whose
convivial<br>
and social gifts have won so much of their esteem and admiration;
but were<br>
I to run on thus, I should recur to every character of my story,
with each<br>
and all of whom you have, doubtless, grown well wearied. So here
for the<br>
last time, and with every kind wish, I say, adieu!</p>

<p>L'ENVOI.</p>

<p>Kind friends,&mdash;It is somewhat unfortunate that the record of
the happiest<br>
portion of my friend's life should prove the saddest part of my
duty as<br>
his editor, and for this reason, that it brings me to that spot
where my<br>
acquaintance with you must close, and sounds the hour when I must
say,<br>
good-bye.</p>

<p>They, who have never felt the mysterious link that binds the
solitary<br>
scribe in his lonely study, to the circle of his readers, can
form no<br>
adequate estimate of what his feelings are when that chain is
about to be<br>
broken; they know not how often, in the fictitious garb of his
narrative,<br>
he has clothed the inmost workings of his heart; they know not
how<br>
frequently he has spoken aloud his secret thoughts, revealing, as
though to<br>
a dearest friend, the springs of his action, the causes of his
sorrow, the<br>
sources of his hope; they cannot believe by what a sympathy he is
bound to<br>
those who bow their heads above his pages; they do not think how
the ideal<br>
creations of his brain are like mutual friends between him and
the world,<br>
through whom he is known and felt and thought of, and by whom he
reaps in<br>
his own heart the rich harvest of flattery and kindness that are
rarely<br>
refused to any effort to please, however poor, however humble.
They know<br>
not this, nor can they feel the hopes, the fears, that stir
within him, to<br>
earn some passing word of praise; nor think they, when won, what
brightness<br>
around his humble hearth it may be shedding. These are the
rewards for<br>
nights of toil and days of thought; these are the recompenses
which pay the<br>
haggard cheek, the sunken eye, the racked and tired head. These
are the<br>
stakes for which one plays his health, his leisure, and his life,
yet not<br>
regrets the game.</p>

<p>Nearly three years have now elapsed since I first made my bow
before you.<br>
How many events have crowded into that brief space! How many
things of<br>
vast moment have occurred! Only think that in the last few months
you've<br>
frightened the French; terrified M. Thiers; worried the Chinese;
and are,<br>
at this very moment, putting the Yankees into a "<i>most uncommon
fix</i>;" not<br>
to mention the minor occupations of ousting the Whigs;
reinstating the<br>
Tories, and making O'Connell Lord Mayor,&mdash;and yet, with all these
and a<br>
thousand other minor cares, you have not forgotten your poor
friend, the<br>
Irish Dragoon. Now this was really kind of you, and in my heart I
thank you<br>
for it.</p>

<p>Do not, I entreat you, construe my gratitude into any sense of
future<br>
favors,&mdash;no such thing; for whatever may be my success with you
hereafter,<br>
I am truly deeply grateful for the past. Circumstances, into
which I<br>
need not enter, have made me for some years past a resident in a
foreign<br>
country, and as my lot has thrown me into a land where the
reputation of<br>
writing a book is pretty much on a par with that of picking a
pocket, it<br>
may readily be conceived with what warm thankfulness I have
caught at any<br>
little testimonies of your approval which chance may have thrown
in my way.</p>

<p>Like the reduced gentlewoman who, compelled by poverty to cry
fresh eggs<br>
through the streets, added after every call, "I hope nobody hears
me;" so<br>
I, finding it convenient, for a not very dissimilar reason, to
write books,<br>
keep my authorship as quietly to myself as need be, and comfort
me with the<br>
assurance that nobody knows me.</p>

<p>A word now to my critics. Never had any man more reason to be
satisfied<br>
with that class than myself. As if you knew and cared for the
temperament<br>
of the man you were reviewing; as if you were aware of the fact
that it was<br>
at any moment in your power, by a single article of severe
censure, to have<br>
extinguished in him forever all effort, all ambition for
success,&mdash;you have<br>
mercifully extended to him the mildest treatment, and meted out
even your<br>
disparagement, with a careful measure.</p>

<p>While I have studied your advice with attention, and read your
criticisms<br>
with care, I confess I have trembled more than once before your
more<br>
palpable praise; for I thought you might be hoaxing me.</p>

<p>Now and then, to be sure, I have been accused of impressing
real<br>
individuals, and compelling them to serve in my book; that this
reproach<br>
was unjust, they who know me can best vouch for, while I myself
can<br>
honestly aver, that I never took a portrait without the consent
of the<br>
sitter.</p>

<p>Others again have fallen foul of me, for treating of things,
places, and<br>
people with which I had no opportunity of becoming personally
acquainted.<br>
Thus one of my critics has showed that I could not have been a
Trinity<br>
College man; and another has denied my military matriculation.
Now,<br>
although both my Latin and my learning are on the peace
establishment, and<br>
if examined in the movements for cavalry, it is perfectly
possible I should<br>
be cautioned, yet as I have both a degree and a commission I
might have<br>
been spared this reproach.</p>

<p>"Of coorse," says Father Malachi Brennan, who leans over my
shoulder while<br>
I write,&mdash;"of coorse you ought to know all about these things as
well as<br>
the Duke of Wellington or Marshal Soult himself. UNDE DERYVATUR
MILES.<br>
Ain't you in the Derry militia?" I hope the Latin and the
translation will<br>
satisfy every objection.</p>

<p>While, then, I have nothing but thankfulness in my heart
respecting the<br>
entire press of my own country, I have a small grudge with my
friends of<br>
the far west; and as this is a season of complaint against the
Yankees,<br>
"Why shouldn't I roll my tub also?" A certain New York paper,
called the<br>
"Sunday Times," has thought fit for some time past to fill its
columns with<br>
a story of the Peninsular war, announcing it as "by the author of
Charles<br>
O'Malley." Heaven knows that injured individual has sins enough
of his own<br>
to answer for, without fathering a whole foundling hospital of
American<br>
balderdash; but this kidnapping spirit of brother Jonathan would
seem to be<br>
the fashion of the day! Not content with capturing Macleod, who
unhappily<br>
ventured within his frontier, he must come over to Ireland and
lay hands<br>
on Harry Lorrequer. Thus difficulties are thickening every day.
When they<br>
dispose of the colonel, then comes the boundary question; after
that there<br>
is Grogan's affair, then me. They may liberate Macleod; [3] they
may<br>
abandon the State of Maine,&mdash;but what recompense can be made to
me for this<br>
foul attack on my literary character? It has been suggested to me
from the<br>
Foreign Office that the editor might be hanged. I confess I
should like<br>
this; but after all it would be poor satisfaction for the injury
done me.<br>
Meanwhile, as Macleod has the <i>pas</i> of me, I'll wait patiently,
and think<br>
the matter over.</p>

<p>[Footnote 3: I have just read that Macleod and Grogan have
been liberated.<br>
May I indulge a hope that <i>my</i> case will engage the sympathies of
the<br>
world during the Christmas holidays. H. L.]</p>

<p>It was my intention, before taking leave of you, to have
apologized<br>
separately for many blunders in my book; but the errors of the
press are<br>
too palpable to be attributed to me. I have written letters
without end,<br>
begged, prayed, and entreated that more care might be bestowed;
but<br>
somehow, after all, they have crept in in spite of me. Indeed,
latterly I<br>
began to think I had found out the secret of it. My publisher,
excellent<br>
man, has a kind of pride about printing in Ireland, and he thinks
the<br>
blunders, like the green cover to the volume, give the thing a
national<br>
look. I think it was a countryman of mine of whom the story is
told, that<br>
he apologized for his spelling by the badness of his pen. This
excuse, a<br>
little extended, may explain away anacronisms, and if it won't I
am sorry<br>
for it, for I have no other.</p>

<p>Here then I conclude: I must say, adieu! Yet can I not do so
before I<br>
again assure you that if perchance I may have lightened an hour
of <i>your</i><br>
solitude, you, my kind friends, have made happy whole weeks and
days of<br>
<i>mine</i>; and if happily I have called up a passing smile upon
<i>your</i> lip,<br>
your favor has spoken joy and gladness to many a heart around
<i>my</i> board.<br>
Is it, then, strange that I should be grateful for the past; be
sorrowful<br>
for the present?</p>

<p>To one and all, then, a happy Christmas; and if before the new
year, you<br>
have not forgotten me, I shall be delighted to have your company
at OUR<br>
MESS.</p>

<p>Meanwhile believe me most respectfully and faithfully
yours,</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several
printed<br>
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the
US<br>
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we usually do
not<br>
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.</p>

<p>We are now trying to release all our eBooks one year in
advance<br>
of the official release dates, leaving time for better
editing.<br>
Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or
corrections,<br>
even years after the official publication date.</p>

<p>Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final
til<br>
midnight of the last day of the month of any such
announcement.<br>
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is
at<br>
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.
 A<br>
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion,
comment<br>
and editing by those who wish to do so.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web sites at:<br>
http://gutenberg.net or<br>
http://promo.net/pg</p>

<p>These Web sites include award-winning information about
Project<br>
Gutenberg, including how to donate, how to help produce our
new<br>
eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter (free!).</p>

<p>Those of you who want to download any eBook before
announcement<br>
can get to them as follows, and just download by date.  This
is<br>
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as
the<br>
indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after
an<br>
announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.</p>

<p>http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext03 or<br>
ftp://ftp.ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext03</p>

<p>Or /etext02, 01, 00, 99, 98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or

<p>Just search by the first five letters of the filename you
want,<br>
as it appears in our Newsletters.</p>

<p>Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)</p>

<p>We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.
 The<br>
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty
hours<br>
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited,
copyright<br>
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.
  Our<br>
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the
value<br>
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce
$2<br>
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new
text<br>
files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of
4000+<br>
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in
2002<br>
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the
total<br>
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's
end.</p>

<p>The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion
eBooks!<br>
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million
readers,<br>
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer
users.</p>

<p>ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM EBOOKS<br>
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBook, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
eBooks,<br>
is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor Michael S.
Hart<br>
through the Project Gutenberg Association (the "Project").<br>
Among other things, this means that no one owns a United States
copyright<br>
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and<br>
distribute it in the United States without permission and<br>

under the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.</p>

<p>Please do not use the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark to
market<br>
any commercial products without permission.</p>

<p>To create these eBooks, the Project expends considerable<br>
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain<br>
works. Despite these efforts, the Project's eBooks and any<br>
medium they may be on may contain "Defects". Among other<br>
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate
or<br>
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other<br>
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged<br>
disk or other eBook medium, a computer virus, or computer<br>
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.</p>
